How to build and publish the website:

 1. Install Apache Maven 3.0.2+ and make its binary 'mvn' available on your PATH.
    See http://maven.apache.org/download.html#Installation.
 2. run "mvn clean site"
 3. Test the built site in your browser from the {path}/target/site folder
 4. If everything looks OK, deploy the site using "mvn clean site-deploy".
 5. Wait for the changes to replicate to the Apache web server or setup 140.211.11.10:80 as 
    a proxy to review the changes (described here: http://www.apache.org/dev/project-site.html) 

To deploy the technical reports use the "-Psite-reports" profile.

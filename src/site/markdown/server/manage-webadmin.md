Web administration for JAMES
============================

The web administration supports for now the CRUD operations on the domains, the users, their mailboxes and their quotas,
 managing mail repositories, performing cassandra migrations, and much more, as described in the following sections.

**WARNING**: This API allow authentication only via the use of JWT. If not configured with JWT, an administrator should ensure an attacker can not use this API.

Please also note **webadmin** is only enabled with **Guice**. You can not use it when using James with **Spring**, as the required injections are not implemented.

In case of any error, the system will return an error message which is json format like this:

```
{
    statusCode: <error_code>,
    type: <error_type>,
    message: <the_error_message>
    cause: <the_detail_message_from_throwable>
}
```

## Cassandra Schema upgrades

Cassandra upgrades implies the creation of a new table. Thus restarting James is needed, as new tables are created on restart.

Once done, we ship code that tries to read from new tables, and if not possible backs up to old tables. You can thus safely run
without running additional migrations.

On the fly migration can be enabled. However, one might want to force the migration in a controlled fashion, and update
automatically current schema version used (assess in the database old versions is no more used, as the corresponding tables are empty).
Note that this process is safe: we ensure the service is not running concurrently on this James instance, that it does not bump
version upon partial failures, that race condition in version upgrades will be idempotent, etc...

These schema updates can be triggered by webadmin using the Cassandra backend.

Note that currently the progress can be tracked by logs.

### Retrieving current Cassandra schema version

```
curl -XGET http://ip:port/cassandra/version
```

Will return:

```
2
```

Where the number corresponds to the current schema version of the database you are using.

Response codes:

 - 200: Success
 - 500: Internal error

### Retrieving latest available Cassandra schema version

```
curl -XGET http://ip:port/cassandra/version
```

Will return:

```
3
```

Where the number corresponds to the latest available schema version of the database you are using. This means you can be
migrating to this schema version.

Response codes:

 - 200: Success
 - 500: Internal error

### Upgrading to a specific version

```
curl -XPOST http://ip:port/cassandra/version/upgrade -d '3'
```


Will schedule the run of the migrations you need to reach schema version 3. The `taskId` will allow you to monitor and manage this process.

```
{"taskId":"3294a976-ce63-491e-bd52-1b6f465ed7a2"}
```

Response codes:

 - 200: Success. The scheduled task taskId is returned.
 - 400: The version is invalid. The version should be a strictly positive number.
 - 410: Error while planning this migration. This resource is gone away. Reason is mentionned in the body.
 - 500: Internal error while creating the migration task.

Note that several calls to this endpoint will be run in a sequential pattern.

If the server restarts during the migration, the migration is silently aborted.


The scheduled task will have the following type `CassandraMigration` and the following `additionalInformation`:

```
{"toVersion":3}
```

### Upgrading to the latest version

```
curl -XPOST http://ip:port/cassandra/version/upgrade/latest
```

Will schedule the run of the migrations you need to reach the latest schema version. The `taskId` will allow you to monitor and manage this process.

```
{"taskId":"3294a976-ce63-491e-bd52-1b6f465ed7a2"}
```

Positionned headers:

 - Location header indicates the location of the resource associated with the scheduled task. Example:

```
Location: /tasks/3294a976-ce63-491e-bd52-1b6f465ed7a2
```

Response codes:

 - 200: Success. The scheduled task taskId is returned.
 - 410: Error while planning this migration. This resource is gone away. Reason is mentionned in the body.
 - 500: Internal error while creating the migration task.

Note that several calls to this endpoint will be run in a sequential pattern.

If the server restarts during the migration, the migration is silently aborted.

The scheduled task will have the following type `CassandraMigration` and the following `additionalInformation`:

```
{"toVersion":2}
```

## Correcting ghost mailbox

This is a temporary workaround for the **Ghost mailbox** bug encountered using the Cassandra backend, as described in MAILBOX-322.

You can use the mailbox merging feature in order to merge the old "ghosted" mailbox with the new one.

```
curl -XPOST http://ip:port/cassandra/mailbox/merging -d '{"mergeOrigin":"id1", "mergeDestination":"id2"}'
```

Will scedule a task for :

 - Delete references to `id1` mailbox
 - Move it's messages into `id2` mailbox
 - Union the rights of both mailboxes

The response to that request will be the scheduled `taskId` :

```
{"taskId":"5641376-02ed-47bd-bcc7-76ff6262d92a"}
```

Positionned headers:

 - Location header indicates the location of the resource associated with the scheduled task. Example:

```
Location: /tasks/3294a976-ce63-491e-bd52-1b6f465ed7a2
```

Response codes:

 - 201: Success. Corresponding task id is returned.
 - 400: Unable to parse the body.

The scheduled task will have the following type `mailboxMerging` and the following `additionalInformation`:

```
{
  "oldMailboxId":"5641376-02ed-47bd-bcc7-76ff6262d92a",
  "newMailboxId":"4555159-52ae-895f-ccb7-586a4412fb50",
  "totalMessageCount": 1,
  "messageMovedCount": 1,
  "messageFailedCount": 0
}
```

## Creating address group

You can use **webadmin** to define address groups.

When a specific email is sent to the group mail address, every group member will receive it.

This feature uses [Recipients rewrite table](/server/config-recipientrewritetable.html) and requires
the [RecipientRewriteTable mailet](https://github.com/apache/james-project/blob/master/server/mailet/mailets/src/main/java/org/apache/james/transport/mailets/RecipientRewriteTable.java)
to be configured.

Note that email addresses are restricted to ASCII character set. Mail addresses not matching this criteria will be rejected.

### Listing groups

```
curl -XGET http://ip:port/address/groups
```

Will return the groups as a list of JSON Strings representing mail addresses. For instance:

```
["group1@domain.com", "group2@domain.com"]
```

Response codes:

 - 200: Success
 - 500: Internal error

### Listing members of a group

```
curl -XGET http://ip:port/address/groups/group@domain.com
```

Will return the group members as a list of JSON Strings representing mail addresses. For instance:

```
["member1@domain.com", "member2@domain.com"]
```

Response codes:

 - 200: Success
 - 400: Group structure is not valid
 - 404: The group does not exist
 - 500: Internal error

### Adding a group member

```
curl -XPUT http://ip:port/address/groups/group@domain.com/member@domain.com
```

Will add member@domain.com to group@domain.com, creating the group if needed

Response codes:

 - 200: Success
 - 400: Group structure or member is not valid
 - 403: Server does not own the requested domain
 - 409: Requested group address is already used for another purpose
 - 500: Internal error

### Removing a group member

```
curl -XDELETE http://ip:port/address/groups/group@domain.com/member@domain.com
```

Will remove member@domain.com from group@domain.com, removing the group if group is empty after deletion

Response codes:

 - 200: Success
 - 400: Group structure or member is not valid
 - 500: Internal error

## Administrating mail repositories

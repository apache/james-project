Web administration for JAMES
============================

The web administration supports for now the CRUD operations on the domains, the users, their mailboxes and their quotas,
 managing mail repositories, performing cassandra migrations, and much more, as described in the following sections.

**WARNING**: This API allow authentication only via the use of JWT. If not configured with JWT, an administrator should ensure an attacker can not use this API.

Please also note **webadmin** is only enabled with **Guice**. You can not use it when using James with **Spring**, as the required injections are not implemented.

In case of any error, the system will return an error message which is json format like this:

```
{
    statusCode: <error_code>,
    type: <error_type>,
    message: <the_error_message>
    cause: <the_detail_message_from_throwable>
}
```

## Cassandra Schema upgrades

Cassandra upgrades implies the creation of a new table. Thus restarting James is needed, as new tables are created on restart.

Once done, we ship code that tries to read from new tables, and if not possible backs up to old tables. You can thus safely run
without running additional migrations.

On the fly migration can be enabled. However, one might want to force the migration in a controlled fashion, and update
automatically current schema version used (assess in the database old versions is no more used, as the corresponding tables are empty).
Note that this process is safe: we ensure the service is not running concurrently on this James instance, that it does not bump
version upon partial failures, that race condition in version upgrades will be idempotent, etc...

These schema updates can be triggered by webadmin using the Cassandra backend.

Note that currently the progress can be tracked by logs.

 - [Retrieving current Cassandra schema version](#Retrieving_current_cassandra_schema_version)
 - [Retrieving latest available Cassandra schema version](#Retrieving_latest_available_cassandra_schema_version)
 - [Upgrading to a specific version](#Upgrading_to_a_specific_version)
 - [Upgrading to the latest version](#Upgrading_to_the_latest_version)

### Retrieving current Cassandra schema version

```
curl -XGET http://ip:port/cassandra/version
```

Will return:

```
2
```

Where the number corresponds to the current schema version of the database you are using.

Response codes:

 - 200: Success
 - 500: Internal error

### Retrieving latest available Cassandra schema version

```
curl -XGET http://ip:port/cassandra/version
```

Will return:

```
3
```

Where the number corresponds to the latest available schema version of the database you are using. This means you can be
migrating to this schema version.

Response codes:

 - 200: Success
 - 500: Internal error

### Upgrading to a specific version

```
curl -XPOST http://ip:port/cassandra/version/upgrade -d '3'
```


Will schedule the run of the migrations you need to reach schema version 3. The `taskId` will allow you to monitor and manage this process.

```
{"taskId":"3294a976-ce63-491e-bd52-1b6f465ed7a2"}
```

Response codes:

 - 200: Success. The scheduled task taskId is returned.
 - 400: The version is invalid. The version should be a strictly positive number.
 - 410: Error while planning this migration. This resource is gone away. Reason is mentionned in the body.
 - 500: Internal error while creating the migration task.

Note that several calls to this endpoint will be run in a sequential pattern.

If the server restarts during the migration, the migration is silently aborted.


The scheduled task will have the following type `CassandraMigration` and the following `additionalInformation`:

```
{"toVersion":3}
```

### Upgrading to the latest version

```
curl -XPOST http://ip:port/cassandra/version/upgrade/latest
```

Will schedule the run of the migrations you need to reach the latest schema version. The `taskId` will allow you to monitor and manage this process.

```
{"taskId":"3294a976-ce63-491e-bd52-1b6f465ed7a2"}
```

Note that several calls to this endpoint will be run in a sequential pattern.

If the server restarts during the migration, the migration is silently aborted.

The scheduled task will have the following type `CassandraMigration` and the following `additionalInformation`:

```
{"toVersion":2}
```

## Correcting ghost mailbox

This is a temporary workaround for the **Ghost mailbox** bug encountered using the Cassandra backend, as described in MAILBOX-322.

You can use the mailbox merging feature in order to merge the old "ghosted" mailbox with the new one.

```
curl -XPOST http://ip:port/cassandra/mailbox/merging -d '{"mergeOrigin":"id1", "mergeDestination":"id2"}'
```

Will scedule a task for :

 - Delete references to `id1` mailbox
 - Move it's messages into `id2` mailbox
 - Union the rights of both mailboxes

The response to that request will be the scheduled `taskId` :

```
{"taskId":"5641376-02ed-47bd-bcc7-76ff6262d92a"}
```

Positionned headers:

 - Location header indicates the location of the resource associated with the scheduled task. Example:

```
Location: /tasks/3294a976-ce63-491e-bd52-1b6f465ed7a2
```

Response codes:

 - 201: Success. Corresponding task id is returned.
 - 400: Unable to parse the body.

The scheduled task will have the following type `mailboxMerging` and the following `additionalInformation`:

```
{
  "oldMailboxId":"5641376-02ed-47bd-bcc7-76ff6262d92a",
  "newMailboxId":"4555159-52ae-895f-ccb7-586a4412fb50",
  "totalMessageCount": 1,
  "messageMovedCount": 1,
  "messageFailedCount": 0
}
```

## Creating address group

You can use **webadmin** to define address groups.

When a specific email is sent to the group mail address, every group member will receive it.

Note that the group mail address is virtual: it does not correspond to an existing user.

This feature uses [Recipients rewrite table](/server/config-recipientrewritetable.html) and requires
the [RecipientRewriteTable mailet](https://github.com/apache/james-project/blob/master/server/mailet/mailets/src/main/java/org/apache/james/transport/mailets/RecipientRewriteTable.java)
to be configured.

Note that email addresses are restricted to ASCII character set. Mail addresses not matching this criteria will be rejected.

## Creating address forwards

You can use **webadmin** to define address forwards.

When a specific email is sent to the base mail address, every forward destination addresses will receive it.

Please note that the base address can be optionaly part of the forward destination. In that case, the base recipient
also receive a copy of the mail. Otherwise he is ommitted.

Forwards can be defined for existing users. It then defers from "groups".

This feature uses [Recipients rewrite table](/server/config-recipientrewritetable.html) and requires
the [RecipientRewriteTable mailet](https://github.com/apache/james-project/blob/master/server/mailet/mailets/src/main/java/org/apache/james/transport/mailets/RecipientRewriteTable.java)
to be configured.

Note that email addresses are restricted to ASCII character set. Mail addresses not matching this criteria will be rejected.

## Administrating DLP Configuration

DLP (stands for Data Leak Prevention) is supported by James. A DLP matcher will, on incoming emails,
execute regular expressions on email sender, recipients or content, in order to report suspicious emails to
an administrator. WebAdmin can be used to manage these DLP rules on a per `senderDomain` basis.

`senderDomain` is domain of the sender of incoming emails, for example: `apache.org`, `james.org`,...
Each `senderDomain` correspond to a distinct DLP configuration.

- [List DLP configuration by sender domain](List_dlp_configuration_by_sender_domain)
- [Store DLP configuration by sender domain](Store_dlp_configuration_by_sender_domain)
- [Remove DLP configuration by sender domain](Remove_dlp_configuration_by_sender_domain)

### List DLP configuration by sender domain

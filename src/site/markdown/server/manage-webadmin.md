Web administration for JAMES
============================

The web administration supports for now the CRUD operations on the domains,the users, their mailboxes and their quotas, as described in the following sections.

**WARNING**: This API allow authentication only via the use of JWT. If not configured with JWT, an administrator should ensure an attacker can not use this API.

Please also note **webadmin** is only enabled with **Guice**. You can not use it when using James with **Spring**, as the required injections are not implemented.

## Administrating domains

curl -XDELETE http://ip:port/domains/domainToBeDeleted
```

Response codes:

```
curl -XGET http://ip:port/domains/domainName
```

Response codes:

 - 204: The domain exists
 - 404: The domain does not exist
 - 500: Internal error while accessing the domains

### Get the list of domains

```
curl -XGET http://ip:port/domains
```

{"domains":["domain1", "domain2"]}
```

Response codes:

 - 200: The domain list was successfully retrieved
 - 500: Internal error while accessing the domains

## Administrating users

### Create a user

```
curl -XPUT http://ip:port/users/usernameToBeUsed -d '{"password":"passwordToBeUsed"}'
```

### Updating a user password

Same than Create, but a user need to exist.

curl -XDELETE http://ip:port/users/userToBeDeleted
```

 - 204: The user was successfully deleted
 - 500: Internal error while deleting the user

### Retrieving the user list

```
curl -XGET http://ip:port/users

 - 404: The user name does not exist
 - 500: Internal error

## Administrating quotas

```

Response codes:
 - 200: Nothing special

## Cassandra Schema upgrades

Cassandra upgrades implies the creation of a new table. Thus restarting James is needed, as new tables are created on restart.

Once done, we ship code that tries to read from new tables, and if not possible backs up to old tables. You can thus safely run
without running additional migrations.

On the fly migration can be enabled. However, one might want to force the migration in a controlled fashion, and update
automatically current schema version used (assess in the database old versions is no more used, as the corresponding tables are empty).
Note that this process is safe: we ensure the service is not running concurrently on this James instance, that it does not bump
version upon partial failures, that race condition in version upgrades will be idempotent, etc...

These schema updates can be triggered by webadmin using the Cassandra backend.

Note that currently the progress can be tracked by logs.

### Retrieving current Cassandra schema version

```
curl -XGET http://ip:port/cassandra/version
```

Will return:

```
2
```

Where the number corresponds to the current schema version of the database you are using.

Response codes:

 - 200: Success
 - 500: Internal error

### Retrieving latest available Cassandra schema version

```
curl -XGET http://ip:port/cassandra/version
```

Will return:

```
3
```

Where the number corresponds to the latest available schema version of the database you are using. This means you can be
migrating to this schema version.

Response codes:

 - 200: Success
 - 500: Internal error

### Upgrading to a specific version

```
curl -XPOST http://ip:port/cassandra/version/upgrade -d '3'
```

Will run the migrations you need to reach schema version 3.

Response codes:

 - 204: Success
 - 400: The version is invalid. The version should be a strictly positive number.
 - 410: Error running the migration. This resource is gone away. Reason is mentionned in the body.
 - 500: Internal error. This can result from a partial migration, in which case the reason is contained in the body.

Note that several calls to this endpoint will be run in a sequential pattern.

If the server restarts during the migration, the migration is silently aborted.

### Upgrading to the latest version

```
curl -XPOST http://ip:port/cassandra/version/upgrade/latest
```

Will run the migrations you need to reach the latest schema version.

Response codes:

 - 204: Success
 - 410: Error running the migration. This resource is gone away. Reason is mentionned in the body.
 - 500: Internal error. This can result from a partial migration, in which case the reason is contained in the body.

Note that several calls to this endpoint will be run in a sequential pattern.

If the server restarts during the migration, the migration is silently aborted.

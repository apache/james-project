  <section name="Mailbox API Responsibility">
    <p>This module contains the interfaces and exceptions to be used by the 
       mailbox clients. It represents the "external view" of the mailbox
       library client.</p>
    <p>The services the mailbox library provides can be summarized as "store/retrieve/search/delete mails" 
       and update the mails metadata (via uid and flags)</p>
    <p>The main entrance interfaces are represented by 3 managers, each responsible
       for a specific area: the mailbox manager, the message manager and the
       subscription manager.</p>
    <p>For example, Apache James Server injects the managers in the POP3, SMTP, IMAP4 servers
       and in the Mailet container.</p>
     <p>Each implementation <a href="mailbox-memory.html">Memory</a>,
        <a href="mailbox-maildir.html">Maildir</a>, 
        <a href="mailbox-jpa.html">JPA</a>) is responsible
        to implement the management interfaces. All "common/util" implementations
        reside in the <a href="mailbox-store.html">Mailbox Store</a> module.</p>

  <section name="Manager Interfaces">
  
    <subsection name="Mailbox Manager">
      <p>The Mailbox Manager is responsible for session creation, operations on mailbox (create, delete, search)
         and to return a Message Manager. It also allows to copy and list messages.
      </p>

        <ul>
            Mailbox manager capabilities represents which operations a mailbox manager is able to support. For now the list is :
            <li>Basic: supports all basic operations</li>

        </ul>

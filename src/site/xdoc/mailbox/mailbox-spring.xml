        <section name="Mailbox Spring Responsibility">
            <p>The Mailbox Spring module is designed to test the loading of mailbox implementations. </p>
        </section>
        
        <section name="Mailbox Spring Classes">
            <p>The module is small. It contains just two classes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>SpringMailbox - this loads the spring-mailbox.xml </li>    
                <li>AnonymousAuthenticator - provides a dummy org.apache.james.mailbox.Authenticator</li>
            </ul>            
            <p>SpringMailbox class is used to load the spring application context from <em>spring-mailbox.xml</em> 
            and provides a method to get beans declared in that context.
            </p>
            
            <p> <em>spring-mailbox.xml</em> contains references to Spring configuration files, one for each mailbox implementation and for other components.
            You might find the following files: <br/></p>
            <ul>
                <li>spring-mailbox-memory.xml</li>
                <li>spring-mailbox-maildir.xml</li>
                <li>spring-mailbox-jpa.xml</li>
                <li>spring-mailbox-authenticator.xml</li>
                <li>spring-mailbox-locker.xml</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Each mailbox configuration file is used to declare beans that will instantiate all components 
            (MailboxSessionMapperFactory, MailboxManager, UidProvider, etc) needed to start that mailbox implementation.</p>

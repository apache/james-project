                        This implementation has been deprecated in the 3.2.0 release of James. It will be removed in the next (3.3.0) release.
                        We strongly encourage you to choose another mailbox implemetation (JPA for traditional SQL or Cassandra for NoSQL).
                        By the way, if you have some development skills and you would like to support this backend,
                        we will be really pleased to help you maintaining this project.

            <p>This implementation stores user mailboxes using JCR (Java Content Repository) technology.</p>
            <p>The default JCR provider used is 
                <a hfre="http://jackrabbit.apache.org/">Apache Jackrabbit</a>.
            </p>
            <p>It only supports the Basic capability.</p>

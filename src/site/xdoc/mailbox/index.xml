  <section name="What Is Apache James Mailbox?">
    <p>The Apache James Mailbox is a library providing a flexible Mailbox storage accessible by mail 
       protocols (IMAP4, POP3, SMTP,...) and other protocols.
    </p>
    <p>It can also be embedded into your application to implement for example 
       the <a href="http://www.mindspring.com/~mgrand/pattern_synopses3.htm#Mailbox">Mailbox Pattern</a>.
    </p>
    <p>The prime usage of this library is clearly to serve as mailbox persistence 
       for IMAP protocol. The API and implementations rely on  
       <a href='http://james.apache.org/server/rfclist/imap4/rfc2060.txt'>RFC 2060 IMAP4rev1</a>
       definitions and requirements but can perfectly be used in any other (non mail server) context. 
    </p>
    <p>The mailbox library supports different persistence mechanisms: MailDir and SQL Database via Apache OpenJPA.
    </p>
    <p>You can <a href="http://james.apache.org/download.cgi">download</a> current 0.4 release. 
       The <a href="apidocs/">API</a> as the schemas for the different implementations are susceptible to evolve.
    </p>
      <ul>Here are the different implementations of the mailbox we propose :
          <li><a href="mailbox-memory.html">Memory</a> for testing purposes</li>
          <li><a href="mailbox-cassandra.html">Cassandra</a></li>
          <li><a href="mailbox-maildir.html">Maildir</a></li>
          <li><a href="mailbox-jpa.html">JPA</a> </li>
      </ul>

    <p><a href="http://james.apache.org/server/3">Apache James Server 3</a> uses this library to implement its user mailboxes.</p>
    <p>Apache James Mailbox is tested and fully compatible with other Apache James libraries
       such as the <a href="http://james.apache.org/imap">Apache James IMAP</a> 
       (see <a href="http://james.apache.org/mpt/index.html">this link</a> 
       for the Mailbox/IMAP integration tests source code) </p>

  <section name="Apache James Mailbox logging">
    <p>Apache James Mailbox uses <a href="http://slf4j.org/">SLF4J</a> as logging facade. For specific bindings one needs to add
    a particular <a href="http://slf4j.org/faq.html#where_is_binding">SLF4J binding</a>.</p>

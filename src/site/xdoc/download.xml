<section name="Apache James 2.2.0 is the best available version">

<p>This release has many enhancements and bug fixes over the previous
release.  See the <a
href="http://james.apache.org/changelog.html">Change Log</a>
for a detailed list of changes.  Some of the earlier defects could
turn a James mail server into an Open Relay.  All users of James are urged to upgrade to James v2.2.0 as soon as
possible.</p>

<section name="Verify the integrity of the files">

<p>It is essential that you verify the integrity of the downloaded
files using the PGP or MD5 signatures.</p>

<p>The PGP signatures can be verified using PGP or GPG.  First
download the <a href="http://www.apache.org/dist/james/KEYS">KEYS</a>
as well as the <code>asc</code> signature file for the particular
distribution.  Make sure you get these files from the <a
href="http://www.apache.org/dist/james/">main distribution
directory</a>, rather than from a mirror. Then verify the signatures
using</p>

<p><code>
% pgpk -a KEYS<br />
% pgpv james-<i>version</i>.tar.gz.asc<br />
</code>
<em>or</em><br />
<code>
% pgp -ka KEYS<br />
% pgp james-<i>version</i>.tar.gz.asc<br />
</code>
<em>or</em><br />
<code>
% gpg --import KEYS<br />
% gpg --verify james-<i>version</i>.tar.gz.asc
</code></p>

<section name="Test Builds">

<p>The software listed above represents the latest Release Build
available from the Apache James Project.  From time to time, we also
make available Test Builds.  These Test Builds are <u>periodic
snapshots during development</u>.  Generally, these are considered
stable snapshots, but they have not undergone as much testing as a
Release Build, nor have they been voted upon for release by the
developer community.  These are simply convenient test builds.
Sometimes the purpose for a Test Build could be soliciting feedback on
a specific change.  Test Builds are announced on the General mailing
list (general&#64;james.apache.org).</p>

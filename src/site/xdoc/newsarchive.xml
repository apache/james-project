        <p>The Apache James Project is happy to announce
           the release of version 0.2 of the Apache James jDKIM library.</p>
        <p>jDKIM is a DKIM implementation library written in Java. It provides
           both verification and signing and also provides Mailets for the
           Apache JAMES project.</p>
        <p>This is the first official release of the library, but the code has
           been in production almost unchanged since two years.</p>
        <p><a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12310990&amp;version=12314300">Read the release notes</a>.</p>
    
        <a name="25072011"><h4>Apache James Mime4J 0.7</h4></a>
        <p>The Apache James Project is happy to announce 
           the release of version 0.7 of the Apache James Mime4J.</p>
        <p>Mime4J is a flexible MIME parsing library written in Java. SAX, DOM and pull parsing styles are 
            supported.</p>
        <p>The 0.7 release brings another round of API enhancements, bug fixes and performance optimizations. 
            A major effort has been put in code reorganization, separating parsing code from DOM manipulation
            code. Mime4J has been restructured into three separate modules: 'core', 'dom' and 'storage'. 
            The 'core' package provides an event-driven SAX style parser that relies on a callback mechanism 
            to report parsing events such as the start of an entity header the start of a body, etc. 
            The 'dom' package contains base/abstract classes and interfaces for MIME-DOM manipulation aiming 
            to provide the base for a full featured traversable DOM. Per default the Mime4J DOM builder stores 
            content of individual body parts in memory. The 'storage' package provides support for more
            complex storage backends such on-disk storage systems, overflow on max limit, or encrypted storage 
            through JSSE API.</p>
          <p>Mime4J 0.7 improves support for headless messages, malformed separation between headers and body
            and adds support for "obsolete" rfc822 syntax (e.g: "Header&lt;somespace&gt;: " style). Parsing 
            performance for quoted printable streams have been considerably improved. A "DecodeMonitor" object 
            has been introduced in most code to define how to deal with malformed input (Lenient vs Strict 
            behaviours). Mime4J 0.7 also provides LenientFieldParser as an alternative to DefaultFieldParser
            when a higher degree of tolerance to non-severe MIME field format violations is desired.</p>

        <p>The Java Apache Mail Enterprise Server (a.k.a. Apache James) Project is happy to announce 
           the release of version 3.0-M1 (Milestone 1) of the Apache James server.</p>
        <p>The Apache James Server is a 100% pure Java enterprise mail server based on open protocols. 
           Currently supported are SMTP/LMTP, POP3, IMAP4 protocols together with several different 
           storage solutions (relational database via JPA and JDBC, File system with MailDir, JCR Content Repsitory).</p>
        <p>The James server also serves as a mail application platform. It hosts the Apache Mailet API,
           and acts has a Mailet container. This feature makes it easy to design, write, and deploy custom applications for mail processing. This modularity and ease of customization is one of James' strengths, and can allow administrators to produce powerful applications surprisingly easily.</p>
        <p>Features for that version include enhancements to nearly every area of functionality, 
           including full IMAP support, improved mailing list capabilities, fastfail support, SMTP API 
           for developing own fastfail filters and the next revision of the Mailet API.</p>
        <p>This was an exciting time in James development and we thank all contributors.</p>
        <p>We are still actively looking for eager, capable developers to contribute to James.

The project Ideas are set out on the Apache GSOC wiki <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/general/SummerOfCode2008#james">here</a>.</p>
        <p>In brief they are:<br/>
        1) Develop a VERP Mailet to allow James to write VERP modified return addresses on outbound messages, and an inbound mailet/matcher to identify VERP bounces and invoke configurable "do something" code.
        <br/>
        And <br/>
        2) James' provided mailing list manager is fine for small closed groups, but lacks the functionality of a more robust MLM, the project is to add some all or more of the following features subscriber and message moderation, double opt-in and bounce handling.</p>

        This move will provide a clearer division between development of the API and development of James server, and we hope this will encourage more participation from external projects.</p>
        <p>The effort will start small, by releasing the current version, and move on to look at the enhancements we've been discussing over on <a href="http://james.apache.org/mail.html">the mailet api list</a> where we will extend a warm welcome to anyone who has something to contribute.</p>
        <p>Eventually we hope to extend the scope of the sub-project to include things like a Reference Implementation independent of James Server and suitable for embedding, an SDK, and possibly a TCK.

      <h4>James PMC react to the closure of Apache Avalon.</h4>
      <p>James PMC would like to reassure all of our users that James Server is alive and well. All of the James team have kept abreast of the Avalon developments culminating in the closure of the Avalon project and dispersal of its codebase. We are are keen to stress that this has little impact on our ability to support and develop Server in both the short and long terms.<br/>Over the coming months we will be finalising and publishing a road map for James Server which will address all of the specific concerns raised by Avalon's closure, but rest assured James Server' future is safe, and we have enthusiasm and plans aplenty.<br/> In the meantime we would like to extend our best wishes to all our friends from Avalon, here's luck with your future projects guys!<br/> If you are at all concerned please subscribe to the server-user mailing list and raise your points there. - 05/Jan/2005</p>

      <h4>James product sources have moved to "Subversion"</h4>
      <p>Subversion is a version control system like CVS, but it has advantages over CVS for Apache Software Foundation (ASF) projects.<br/> In common with all other ASF projects we have reviewed our use of CVS and migrated our code to Subversion.<br/>
         Have a look at this <a href="server/FAQ.html#17">FAQ</a> for further details. - 05/Jan/2005</p>

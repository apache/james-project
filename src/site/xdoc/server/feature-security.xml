        <subsection name="Apache James 3.0.0">
            <p>The Apache James Server version 3.0.0 is vulnerable to Java deserialization issues.</p>
            <p>One can use this for privilege escalation.</p>
            <p>This issue can be mitigated by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Upgrading to James 3.0.1</li>
                <li>Using a recent JRE (Exploit could not be reproduced on OpenJdk 8 u141)</li>
                <li>Exposing JMX socket only to localhost (default behaviour)</li>
                <li>Possibly running James in a container</li>
            </ul>

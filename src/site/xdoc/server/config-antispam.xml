  <title>Apache James Server 3 - Antispam Configuration</title>

  <section name="Antispam Configuration">
  
    <p>Apache James Server Anti-Spam system can be configured via two main different mechanisms:</p>
    
    <ul>
       <li>SMTP Hooks; see <a href="https://github.com/apache/james-project/tree/master/server/app/src/main/resources/smtpserver.xml">examples</a>.</li>
       <li>Mailets; see <a href="https://github.com/apache/james-project/tree/master/server/app/src/main/resources/mailetcontainer.xml">examples</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <subsection name="AntiSpam SMTP Hooks">
  
      <p>"FastFail" SMTP Hooks acts to reject before spooling
          on the SMTP level. SpamAssasin hook can be used as a fastfail hook, therefore
          SpamAssassin must run as a server on the same machine as the Apache James Server.</p>
      
      <p>SMTP Hooks for non-existent users, DSN filter, domains with invalid MX record, 
          can also be configured.</p>
          
    </subsection>

    <subsection name="AntiSpam Mailets">
    
    <ul>
      <li>Black listing Mailet</li>
      <li>Grey listing Mailet</li>
      <li>SpamAssassin Mailet is designed to classify the messages as spam or not 
          with an configurable score threshold. Usually a message will only be 
          considered as spam if it matches multiple criteria; matching just a single test 
          will not usually be enough to reach the threshold.</li>
      <li>BayesianAnalysis in the Mailet uses Bayesian probability to classify mail as 
          spam or not spam. It relies on the training data coming from the usersâ€™ judgment. 
          Users need to manually judge as spam and send to spam@thisdomain.com, oppositely, 
          if not spam they then send to not.spam@thisdomain.com. BayesianAnalysisfeeder learns 
          from this training dataset, and build predictive models based on Bayesian probability. 
          There will be a certain table for maintaining the frequency of Corpus for keywords 
          in the database. Every 10 mins a thread in the BayesianAnalysis will check and update 
          the table. Also, the correct approach is to send the original spam or non-spam 
          as an attachment to another message sent to the feeder in order to avoid bias from the 
          current sender's email header.</li>

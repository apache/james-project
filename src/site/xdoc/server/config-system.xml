        <section name="Server Wide Configuration">

            <subsection name="Introduction">

                <p>There are a number of global configuration files that do not fall into any one
                    component. They have effects that are global in scope across the server.</p>

                <p>Some of these files are crucial, while others can be ignored by any but the most sophisticated
                    server administrators.</p>

            </subsection>

            <subsection name="spring-server.xml">

                <p>In James distribution, the spring files are located under conf/context folder and splitted into a main
                    file (james-server-context.xml) which imports 3 other files (1 per mailbox type): james-mailbox-jpa-context.xml,
                    james-mailbox-maildir-context.xml, james-mailbox-memory-context.xml.</p>

                <p>Consult <a href="https://github.com/apache/james-project/tree/master/server/container/spring/src/main/resources/META-INF/org/apache/james/spring-server.xml">spring-server.xml</a> in GIT to
                    get some examples and hints.</p>

                <p>spring beans files are the place where the Apache James Server wiring is done. It should be modified only by expert-users.</p>

                <p>In combination with james-database.properties and META-INF/persistence.xml, the datasource to access the database is defined in spring-server.xml</p>

            </subsection>

            <subsection name="james-database.properties">

                <p>This configuration file is only relevant when using JPA, with Spring or Guice.</p>

                <p>Consult <a href="https://github.com/apache/james-project/tree/master/server/app/src/main/resources/james-database.properties">james.properties</a> in GIT to get some examples and hints.</p>

                <p>The database connection in database.properties</p>

                <p>James has the capacity to use a JDBC-compatible database for storage of both message and user
                    data. This section explains how to configure James to utilize a database for storage.</p>

                <p>To avoid vendor-specific issues, the JPA (Java Persistence Architecture) is used (using the Apache OpenJPA implementation).</p>

                <p>There must be a database instance accessible from the James server.  An account with appropriate
                    privileges (select, insert, delete into tables, and on initial startup creation of tables) and
                    with sufficient quota for the data to be inserted into the database must be available.</p>

                <p>Also, since James will use JDBC to access the database, an appropriate JDBC driver must be
                    available for installation. You can place the JDBC driver jar in the conf/lib folder, it will
                    be automatically loaded.</p>

                <dl>
                    <dt><strong>database.driverClassName</strong></dt>
                    <dd>he class name of the database driver to be used.</dd>
                    <dt><strong>database.url</strong></dt>
                    <dd>The JDBC connection URL for your database/driver.</dd>
                    <dt><strong>database.username</strong></dt>
                    <dd>The user id of the database account to be used by this connection.</dd>
                    <dt><strong>database.password</strong></dt>
                    <dd>The password of the database account to be used by this connection.</dd>
                    <dt><strong>vendorAdapter.database</strong></dt>
                    <dd>Supported adapters are: DB2, DERBY, H2, HSQL, INFORMIX, MYSQL, ORACLE, POSTGRESQL, SQL_SERVER, SYBASE .</dd>
                    <dt><strong>openjpa.streaming</strong></dt>
                    <dd>true or false - Use streaming for Blobs. This is only supported on a limited set of databases atm. You
                        should check if its supported by your DB before enable it. See <a href="http://openjpa.apache.org/builds/latest/docs/manual/ref_guide_mapping_jpa.html">http://openjpa.apache.org/builds/latest/docs/manual/ref_guide_mapping_jpa.html</a> (#7.11. LOB Streaming).</dd>
                </dl>

                <p>Note for postgresql databases: Add standard_conforming_strings=off to your postgresql.xml, otherwise you
                    will get ""Invalid escape string Hint: Escape string must be empty or one character. {prepstmnt 174928937

            <subsection name="META-INF/persistence.xml">

                <p>Consult <a href="https://github.com/apache/james-project/tree/master/server/app/src/main/resources/META-INF/persistence.xml">META-INF/persistence.xml</a> in GIT to get some examples and hints.</p>

                <p>The JPA mapping and properties are defined in the in META-INF/persistence.xml.</p>

                <p>You can override the definition in external file and importing the external file in the persistence.xml (see jpa-mappings.xml provided example in GIT)</p>

            <subsection name="jmx.properties">

                <p>Consult <a href="https://github.com/apache/james-project/tree/master/server/app/src/main/resources/jmx.properties">jmx.properties</a> in GIT to get some examples and hints.</p>

                <p>This is used to configure the JMX MBean server via which all management is achieved (also used by via the james-cli).</p>

                <dl>
                    <dt><strong>jmx.enabled</strong></dt>
                    <dd>(Guice only). Boolean. Should the JMX server be enabled? Defaults to `true`.</dd>
                    <dt><strong>jmx.address</strong></dt>
                    <dd>The IP address (host name) the MBean Server will bind/listen to.</dd>
                    <dt><strong>jmx.port</strong></dt>
                    <dd>The port number the MBean Server will bind/listen to.</dd>
                </dl>

                <p>To access from a remote location, it has been reported that -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false is
                    needed in the startup script.</p>

            </subsection>

            <subsection name="sqlResources.xml">

                <p>Consult <a href="https://github.com/apache/james-project/tree/master/server/app/src/main/resources/sqlResources.xml">sqlResources.xml</a> in GIT to get some examples and hints.</p>

                <p>This file is deprecated but some mailets... still need it. The standard way to access database
                    is JPA, but some functionalities are not yet migrated and still need the sqlResources.xml resources.</p>

                <p>The precise SQL statements used by Apache James Server to modify and view data stored in the database
                    are specified in sqlResources.xml file.</p>

                <p>If you are using a SQL database with unusual SQL commands or data types, you may
                    need to add special entries to this file.  The James team
                    does try to keep sqlResources.xml updated, so if you do run into a
                    special case, please let us know.</p>

                <p>Also, if the database tables are not created a priori, but rather are to be created by James
                    upon startup, special attention should be paid to the "create table" statements in this file.  Such
                    statements tend to be both very database and very database instance specific.</p>

  <title>Apache James Server 3 - Monitor Folders</title>
 </properties>

  <section name="Monitor Folders">
  
    <subsection name="Monitor ./var Folder Usage">
    
    <p>The directory structure in ./var is shown hereafter.</p>
  
<source>
mail
+-error
+-address-error
+-relay-denied
+-spam

store
+-maildir
+-derby
+-jackrabbit
+-activemq
  +-brokers
    +-james
  +-blob-transfer
    +-outgoing
    +-spool
</source>

      <p>The $JAMES_ROOT/var folder is the place where James Server writes and reads the
         files it needs to achieve its functions.</p>

      <p>There should be two folders in var:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>mail</li>
        <li>store</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The mail folder does NOT contain the users mails
         (look at store folder (or your external database) to find the mailboxes).
         The mail folder contains the mails rejected during the spooling (depending on 
         mailetcontainer.xml configuration). Sub folders of 
         var/mail can be address-error, error, relay-denied, spam</p>
      
       <p>The store folder contains the files related to database, activemq,... needed by James.
         James Server default settings comes with a embedded Derby database that stores the 
         users, domains and mailboxes (the user mails) (see store/derby folder).</p>
         
       <p>Of course, if you changed database.properties and still use a database for the mailboxes,
          you will have to look for the users, domains and mailboxes in your database, whatever,
          wherever it is.</p>
     
        <p>You can find in store folder sub-folders such as:</p>
     
<source>
activemq
+-brokers
  +-james
+-blob-transfer
  +-outgoing
  +-spool
</source>
          
          <p>The <a href="dev-activemq.html">activemq component</a> is configured to use this folder
             for queue (and topics if any) processing.</p>
     
<source>
maildir
</source>     
         
         <p>You can configure James to use MailDir as storage for the user
            mailboxes. Use var/store/maildir folder to contain the user's
            mails.</p>

    </subsection>

    <subsection name="Monitor tmp Folder Usage">
    
      <p>For some certain functions, James uses the system temporary folder (/tmp on linux).
         The system temp can be populated with some temporary files, but James should remove
         them after a short time.</p>

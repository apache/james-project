  <section name="Custom SMTP Hooks Implementations">

    <subsection name="Why a Custom SMTP Hook">

      <p>What to do if the Hook API is not enough for you ? You want for example 
         to write a code which handles a new command like "YOURCOOLCOMMAND: whatever@example".</p>
    
      <p>For this kind of needs you should implement the CommandHandler interface. 
         This gives you a lower-level API to handle this kind of tasks. If you want 
         to support a custom Hook in your <code>CommandHandler</code> its the best
         to just extend <code>AbstractHookableCmdHandler</code>.</p>
         
    </subsection>

    <subsection name="Things to Remember ">

      <p>Be aware that your implementation needs to be thread-safe as it will get used as singleton. 
         If you need to store temporary information within the SMTP Transaction/Session you should
         use the <code>SMTPSession.getState().put(...)</code> 
         and <code>SMTPSession.getConnectionState().put(...)</code> methods.</p>
 
      <p>For a more explanation see the <a href="http://james.apache.org/protocols/apidocs/index.html">apidocs</a> 
        for the protocols library which is used by James SMTP Server.</p>

    </subsection>

    <subsection name="Get your Hook implementations loaded">
  
      <p>Just create a jar file which contains your code and put it in /path/to/james/conf/lib/ 
      folder. The jar will get picked up by the ClassLoader automatic then.</p>
    
      <p>After that open the smtpserver.xml file and add your hook to the <code>&lt;handlers&gt;&lt;/handlers&gt;</code> block in the order you 
       want to have it executed. So if you have 2 MailHook implementation make sure the first one 
       which is listed in smtpserver.xml is the one you want to call first.</p>

    </subsection>

    <subsection name="Return-Codes">

      <p>Each of the Hooks need to return a HookResult to tell the SMTPServer 
        if the next registered Hook should get called or not.</p>
    
      <p>For this the HookReturnCode is used.</p>

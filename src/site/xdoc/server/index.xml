        <p>The server project wires together the different libraries composing James to provide a running service. It introduces
            for example Netty wrappers for protocols, the Mail Queue component as well as Mailet container for mail processing,
            and storage API for server related storage. Wiring is done thanks to Inversion of Control using either Guice or Spring.</p>

        <p>This documentation is intended to be an introduction to the concepts behind the Apache James Server usage, as well
          as a guide to <a href="install.html">install</a>, <a href="config.html">configure</a> ,
          <a href="manage.html">manage</a>, <a href="monitor.html">monitor</a>
          and <a href="dev.html">develop</a> Apache James Server.</p>

         <p>You can also have a look to the last stable version</p>

        <p>Apache James Server 3.8.0 represents the leading edge of development. This code stream has many more
          features than the 2.3 code, but is not be as well tested in production. Reasonable
          configuration compatibility has been retained with 2.3.2.</p>
          
        <p>Apache James Server 3.8.0 and following versions require Java 1.11. A migration guide for
           users willing to upgrade from 2.3 to 3.8.0 is <a href="upgrade-2.3.html">available</a>. If relying on Guice
           wiring, you can use some additional components (Cassandra, OpenSearch, ...).</p>

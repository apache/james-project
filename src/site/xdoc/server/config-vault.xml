    </properties>

    <body>

        <p>
            Deleted Messages Vault is the component in charge of retaining messages before they are going to be deleted.
            Messages stored in the Deleted Messages Vault could be deleted after exceeding their retentionPeriod (explained below).
            It also supports to restore or export messages matching with defined criteria in <a href="https://james.apache.org/server/manage-webadmin.html#Deleted_Messages_Vault">WebAdmin deleted messages vault document</a>
            by using <a href="https://james.apache.org/server/manage-webadmin.html#Deleted_Messages_Vault">WebAdmin endpoints</a>
        </p>
        <section name="Deleted Messages Vault Configuration">

            <p>
                Note: This feature requires Guice wiring.
                To make James use DeletedMessageVault, you also need to configure the PreDeletionHook for it.
                Example is at <a href="server/config-listeners.html">Mailbox Listener Configuration</a>
            </p>

    <p>You need to make sure that your user/domain/mail repository configuration is correct before managing.  If 
    you change your user/domain/mail repository type (i.e. file to database) or the configuration of your user repository 
    (i.e. the file or database URL) after you have added user/domain/mail, you may lose your user/domain/mail data.  Please change these 
    values with care.</p>
  
    <p>After you've done this, restart James to ensure that any changes you've made in 
       the configuration are incorporated into the running system.</p>
       
     <p>You are now ready to manage <a href="manage-domains.html">Domains</a>, 
       <a href="manage-users.html">Users</a> and <a href="manage-recipientrewrite.html">Recipient Rewrite Table</a>.</p>

    <p>You can manage James via:</p>
    
    <ol>
      <li><a href="#Manage_via_CLI">CLI (Client Line Interface)</a></li>
      <li><a href="#Manage_via_JMX">JMX (Java Management Extension)</a></li>
    </ol>
    
    <subsection name="Manage via CLI">
  
      <p>Once James is up and listening, managing via the command line interface is simple.</p>
      
      <p>cd bin</p>
      
      <p>./james-cli.sh (or james-cli.bat on windows) ./james-cli.sh -h localhost -p 9999</p>

      <p>You will be shown with a list of commands.</p>

      <source>
  usage: java org.apache.james.cli.ServerCmd --host &lt;arg&gt; &lt;command&gt;
    -h,--host &lt;/arg&gt;   node hostname or ip address
    -p,--port &lt;/arg&gt;   remote jmx agent port number
  Available commands:
    adduser &lt;/username&gt; &lt;/password&gt;
    removeuser &lt;/username&gt;
    listusers
    adddomain &lt;/domainname&gt;
    removedomain &lt;/domainname&gt;
    listdomains
    containsdomain
      </source>
  
      <p>Note the address and port defined in conf/jmx.properties (default is jmx.address=127.0.0.1 and jmx.port=9999)</p>

    <subsection name="Manage via JMX">
    
      <p>James can be managed via JMX.</p>
      
      <p>The managed objects are exposed from localhost only (for security reasons) on the following URL:</p>
      
      <p><code>service:jmx:rmi://localhost/jndi/rmi://localhost:999/jmxrmi </code></p>
      
      <p>Simply launch jconsole to access the exposed attributes and methods.</p>

      <div class="ui-widget">
        <div class="ui-state-error ui-corner-all" style="padding: 0 .7em;"> 
          <p><span class="ui-icon ui-icon-alert" style="float: left; margin-right: .3em;"></span> 
          <strong>JMX on Windows:</strong>
          to let windows start with jmx username/password enabled, 
          you need to modify the security settings for the jmx files like descripted here:
          <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/guide/management/security-windows.html">
          http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/guide/management/security-windows.html</a>
        </p>
        </div>
      </div>
-->
      <p>If you want a remote access, change 'localhost' to your server hostname in the previous URL:</p>
      
      <p><code>service:jmx:rmi://localhost/jndi/rmi://localhost:999/jmxrmi </code></p>
      
      <p>To manage through a firewall, you will have to take care to random ports creation (read
         <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/management/agent.html">JMX agent</a>
         , 
         <a href="http://olegz.wordpress.com/2009/03/23/jmx-connectivity-through-the-firewall">JMX through firewall</a>
         and

      </p>
      
      <p>You can install a web application management tool such as jmanage. 
         You will get screens such as the following one.</p>

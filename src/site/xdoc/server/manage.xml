  <section name="Manage James Server">

    <p>You need to make sure that your user/domain/mail repository configuration is correct before managing.  If 
    you change your user/domain/mail repository type (i.e. file to database) or the configuration of your user repository 
    (i.e. the file or database URL) after you have added user/domain/mail, you may lose your user/domain/mail data.  Please change these 
    values with care.</p>
  
    <p>After you've done this, restart James to ensure that any changes you've made in 
       the configuration are incorporated into the running system.</p>
       
     <p>You are now ready to manage Some internal James data-structure.</p>

      <ul>You can do this:
          <li>Using <a href="manage-cli.html">The command line client</a></li>
          <li>Using <a href="manage-webadmin.html">The web REST interface</a> (Guice only)</li>
          <li>Using <a href="manage-jmx.html">The JMX interface</a> (Experimental)</li>

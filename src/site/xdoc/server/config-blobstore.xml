        <section name="BlobStore Configuration">
            <p>
                BlobStore is the dedicated component to store blobs, non-indexable content.
                James uses the BlobStore for storing blobs which are usually mail contents, attachments, deleted mails...
                You can choose the underlying implementation of BlobStore to fit with your James setup.
                It could be the implementation on top of Cassandra or file storage service like Openstack Swift, AWS S3.

                This configuration is only applicable with Guice products.
            </p>
            <p>
                Consult <a href="https://github.com/apache/james-project/blob/master/dockerfiles/run/guice/cassandra-rabbitmq/destination/conf/blob.properties">blob.properties</a>
                in GIT to get some examples and hints.

                <dd>Consequently, all the requested deletions will not be performed, meaning that blobstore will only grow.</dd>

            <subsection name="Cassandra BlobStore Cache">
                <p>A Cassandra cache can be enabled to reduce latency when reading small blobs frequently.
                    A dedicated keyspace with a replication factor of one is then used.
                    Cache eviction policy is TTL based.
                    Only blobs below a given threshold will be stored.
                    To be noted that blobs are stored within a single Cassandra row, hence a low threshold should be used.

            <subsection name="Encryption choice">
                <p>
                    Data can be optionally encrypted with a symmetric key using AES before being stored in the blobStore. As many user relies
                    on third party for object storage, a compromised third party will not escalate to a data disclosure. Of course, a
                    performance price have to be paid, as encryption takes resources.

                <p>If AES encryption is enabled, then the following properties MUST be present:</p>

                    Here is an example of how you can generate the above values (be mindful to customize the byte lengths in order to add
                    enough entropy.

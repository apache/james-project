<section name="The Mailet processor pipeline">
  <p>
     This is James sitemap. It defines how each incoming mail will be
     processed. Incoming mails begins their process at the first mailet in the
     pipe. Each step is described by a &lt;servet&gt; tag with some attributes:
         &lt;mailet match="[matchClass]=[matchParameters]"
                    class="[mailetClass]"&gt;.
     The Matcher class split the mail into two Collections: one with all recipients
     matching conditions and the other with all recipient not matching. All information
     in the mail except recipients cloned so the message that both matching and not matching
     are identical (again except recipients). The matching recipients and mail will be passed to
     the specified mailet for processing. After processing both mails, the
     untouched not-matching mail and the processed matching mail, each go to next step in
     the processor. Some mailets will indicate the mail should be consumed and no continue processing.
     The Null mailet for example will simply consume any incoming mail as will the RemoteDelivery
     since after delivery the mail needs no more processing.

  <subsection name="Matchers">
    <p>
       The Matcher interface defines how match class should work. Their work is
       to split a Vector of recipients into two: the ones matching a specified

       Mailet are classes that process a message. They are
       passed a Mail object on which they can perform any kind of task.
       Clever use of mailets allow you to write an email-based application.
       Simple mailets provide basic mail functionality like mail forwarding,
       mailing list, "I'm on vacation" message, mail logging etc. As simply as
       these mailet, you can write and deploy your own mailet to perform any kind of task.
      <br>
         Here you are some of the mailets bundled with James along with their configuration:
       </br>
    </p>
    <b>Null</b>

        Consume any incoming mail. No configuration needed.

        &lt;/mailet&gt;
        </br>
    </blockquote>
    <b>debug.Identity</b>
    <blockquote>
         Leave any incoming mail untouched. A debug mailet
         (not really useful).
         No configuration needed.

            configurations.</br>

    <b>Redirect</b>
  <dl>  <dt>A mailet providing configurable redirection services<br></br>
      This mailet can produce listserver, forward and notify behaviour, with the 
      original message intact, attached, appended or left out altogether.<br></br>
      This built in functionality is controlled by the configuration as laid out 
      below.</dt>
  </dl>
  <p>However it is also designed to be easily subclassed to make authoring redirection 
    mailets simple. <br></br>
    By extending it and overriding one or more of its methods new behaviour can 
    be quickly created without the author having to address any other issue than 
    the relevant one. For more information see the javadocs</p>
  <p>The configuration parameters are:</p>

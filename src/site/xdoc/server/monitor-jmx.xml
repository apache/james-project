  what you mean with how I see permanent errors ?
  unknow users are in ValidRcptHandler
  but if someone would just ignore the 5xx return code on rcpt and suply the data it would return a permanent error
  so yes it could be in there too
  maybe we should only count the first 5xx in a transaction
  
  for the rejected message, I would except to be counted as ok in the stats
  why
  it's not an smtp protocol error
  5xx is an error
  thats the whole point of the stats
  see how many messages are rejected via permanent error and how many via temporary error
  what's the difference between permanet and temporary ?
  temporary will get try to redelivered later
  like greylisting is temporary

    <p>You can monitor James Server via JMX.</p>

    <p>The managed objects are exposed from localhost only (for security reasons) on the following URL:</p>
      
    <p><code>service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://localhost:9999/jmxrmi</code></p>
      
    <p>Simply launch jconsole to access the exposed attributes and methods.
       Active Connections active per component, limits,... can be displayed and following services can 
       be monitored:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>IMAP</li>
      <li>POP3</li>
      <li>SMTP</li>
      <li>LMTP</li>
      <li>RemoteManager</li>
      <li>DNSService</li>
      <li>Queues</li>
    </ul>
     
    <p>If you want to access the JXM server from a remote location, you can <a href="config-system.html">configure

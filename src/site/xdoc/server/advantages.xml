          <p>100% pure Java Mail server designed to be a complete and portable enterprise
            mail engine solution.</p>

          <p>Supports currently available IETF protocols, including SMTP, LMTP, POP3, IMAP4, ManageSIEVE. We also plan to support JMAP.</p>

          <p>Apache James Server is able to store user and message data either in any JPA-compatible database,
            in Cassandra (allowing fast, reliable, even real-time replicated storage) and on a file-system (Maildir).</p>

          <p>Provides a powerful, flexible mail application engine through support for the Apache Mailet
            API.  With its Mailet pipeline architecture, Apache James Server can be used not only to provide standard e-mail
            services, but also to implement custom e-mail applications.</p>

          <p>Apache James Server serves as a mail application platform.</p>

          <p>The Apache James Project hosts the Apache Mailet API,
            and provides the Mailet container. These features makes it easy
            to design, write, and deploy custom applications for mail processing.</p>

          <p>This modularity and ease of customization is one of Apache James'
            strengths, and can allow administrators to produce powerful
            applications surprisingly easily. - <a href="dev-extend.html">read more</a></p>

          <p>Apache James Server 3.0 is now built on top of Spring 3.0 or Guice in replacement of
            the <a href="http://avalon.apache.org/">Avalon</a> Application Framework.
            With Spring, We keep the good development practices introduced by Avalon such as
            Component Oriented Programming and  Inversion of Control. The stable and robust
            Spring container provides a strong foundation for the Apache James Server.</p>

          <p>A special focus has been brought to the performance: Apache James Server can process more than
            100 mails per second. Deployed in production environments and has proven itself
            to be a robust  and high performance mail solution. Tests indicate that
            version 3.0 is able to maintain a constant mail throughput rate of thousands of
            messages/minute for continuous periods  - <a href="feature-performance.html">read more</a></p>

  <title>Apache James Server 3 - Writing a Custom Mailet</title>
 </properties>

<body>

<section name="Writing a Custom Mailet">

  <p>
    Implementing a custom mailet is generally a simple task, most of whose complexity
    lies in coding the actual work to be done by the mailet.  This is largely due to the
    simplicity of the Mailet interface and the fact that a GenericMailet class is provided
    as part of the Mailet package.
  </p>

  <p>
    In this discussion we will assume that any mailet being implemented is a subclass of
    GenericMailet.  The GenericMailet class serves to abstract away of the configuration and
    logging details.  While it provides a noop implementation of the init() and destroy() methods,
    these can be easily overridden to provide useful functionality.
  </p>

  <p>
    In general, the only four methods that you should need to implement are init(), destroy(),
    getMailetInfo(), and service(Mail).  And only the last is required in all cases.
  </p>

  <subsection name="Configuration">
    <p>
      As described in the <a href="config-mailetcontainer.html">SpoolManager configuration
      section</a>, mailets are configured with a set of String (name, value) pairs.  These values are
      passed into the Mailet upon initialization (although the details of this process are hidden by
      the GenericMailet implementation).  GenericMailet provides access to this configuration
      information through use of the getInitParameter(String) method.  Passing in the name of the
      requested configuration value will yield the value if set, and null otherwise.  Configuration
      values are available inside the init(), destroy(), and service(Mail) methods.
    </p>
  </subsection>

  <subsection name="Logging">

    <p>
      There is a simple logging mechanism provided by the Mailet API.  It does not support
      logging levels, so any log filtering will have to be implemented in the Mailet code.
      Logging is done by calling one of the two logging methods on GenericMailet - log(String)
      or log(String,Throwable).  Logging is available inside the init(), destroy(), and service(Mail)
      methods.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please note that the log() method logs with DEBUG level. You will need to define that DEBUG level
      in the log4j.properties.
    </p>
    <p>
      The value of getMailetInfo() for the Mailet is prepended to the log entries for that
      Mailet.  So it may be desirable for you to override this method so you can distinguish mailet
      log entries by Mailet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alternatively, you can instantiate your own logger and log with different level, as show in the
      following snippet (don't forget to update the log4j.properties so you log are taken into account).
    </p>

<source>
package com.test;

import jakarta.mail.MessagingException;

import org.apache.mailet.Mail;
import org.apache.mailet.base.GenericMailet;
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

public class MyMailet extends GenericMailet{
  private static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(MyMailet.class);
  @Override
  public void service(Mail mail) throws MessagingException {
    log("log via mailet logger with INFO level");
    logger.info("Log via slf4j with INFO level !!! Add log4j.logger.com.test=INFO, CONS, FILE in the log4j.properties");
    logger.debug("Log via slf4j with DEBUG level !!! Add log4j.logger.com.test=DEBUG, CONS, FILE in the log4j.properties");
  }
}
</source>
</subsection>

<subsection name="Initialization">
  <p>
    As part of the Mailet lifecycle, a Mailet is guaranteed to be initialized immediately after
    being instantiated.  This happens once and only once for each Mailet instance.  The
    Initialization phase is where configuration parsing and per-Mailet resource creation generally
    take place.  Depending on your Mailet, it may or may not be necessary to do any initialization
    of the mailet.  Initialization logic is implemented by overriding the init() method of
    GenericMailet.
  </p>
</subsection>

<subsection name="Servicing">
  <p>
    The bulk of the Mailet logic is expected to be invoked from the service(Mail) method.  This
    method is invoked each time a mail message is to be processed by the mailet.  The message is
    passed in as an instance of the Mail interface, which is part of the Mailet API.</p>
    <p>The Mail interface is essentially a light wrapper around JavaMail's MimeMessage class with a
    few important differences.  See the Javadoc for the interface for a description of the additional
    methods available on this wrapper.
  </p>
</subsection>

<subsection name="Destruction">
  <p>
    As part of the Mailet lifecycle, a Mailet is guaranteed to be destroyed when the container
    cleans up the Mailet.  This happens once and only once for each Mailet instance.  The
    Destruction phase is where per-Mailet resource release generally takes place.  Depending
    on your Mailet, it may or may not be necessary to do any destruction
    of the mailet.  Destruction logic is implemented by overriding the destroy() method of
    GenericMailet.
  </p>
</subsection>

<section name="Deploying a Custom Mailet">

  <p>
    Once a Mailet has been successfully implemented there are only a couple of
    additional steps necessary to actually deploy the Mailet.
  </p>

  <subsection name="Adding Your Mailet to the Classpath">
    <p>
      The Mailet must be added to James' classpath so that the Mailet can be loaded by James.  There
      are two ways to add a custom Mailet to the classpath so that James will be able to load the
      Mailet.  These are:
    </p>
    <p>
      1a. Download the source distribution, add a jar file containing the custom files to the lib
      directory of the unpacked source distribution, and build a new .tar.gz/zip file by following the
      directions <a href="build-instructions.html">here</a>.  This new tar.gz/zip file will now
      include your custom classes.
    </p>
    <p>
    or
    </p>
    <p>
      1b. Place a jar file containing the custom class files in
      /path/to/james/conf/lib/ subdirectory with JAMES-Spring or /path/to/james/conf/extensions-jars/ subdirectory with JAMES-Guice.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. The mailetpackages entity is no longer required, the class attribute of mailets and matchers now takes a fully qualified class name e.g.
    <p>
<source>
&lt;mailet match="All" class="com.your.company.MyMailet"/&gt;
</source>
    </p>
    After that, restart James server.
    </p>
  </subsection>

  <subsection name="Add custom Guice injections for extensions">
    <p>Upon injections, the user can reference additional guice modules, that are going to be used only upon extensions instantiation.
    In order to do that:</p>
    <p> 1. Place the jar containing the guice module that should be used to instantiate your extensions within the /extensions-jars folder</p>
    <p> 2. Register your module fully qualified class name within <a href="https://github.com/apache/james-project/blob/master/server/apps/distributed-app/sample-configuration/extensions.properties">
      extensions.properties</a> under the <code>guice.extension.module</code> key.</p>
  </subsection>

  <subsection name="James Configuration">
    <p>Configuration of the processor chain is discussed
    <a href="config-mailetcontainer.html">elsewhere</a> in this documentation.  The
    details of configuring mailet deployment is discussed at length.  Here we will only comment
    that it is important to add the appropriate mailet package for your custom mailet to the
    &lt;mailetpackages&gt; list and that the name of your mailet should not conflict with any of
    the mailets described <a href="dev-provided-mailets.html">here</a>.

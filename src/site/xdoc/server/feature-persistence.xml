    <subsection name="Introduction">
  
      <p>The <b>Mailbox</b> persists users' Inbox, Sent Items, Trash... folders with their mails.</p>
      
      <p>The <b>Mail Repository Store</b> persists  spam, error,... mails, so nothing to do with users visible mails.</p>
  
      <p>In case of database access, both Mailbox and Mail Repository Store use database connection defined via database.properties.</p>

    <subsection name="Mailbox Persistence">
  
      <p>Apache James Server uses the <a href="http://james.apache.org/mailbox">Apache James Mailbox</a> storage system 
         to store the users mailboxes.</p>
  
      <p>The mailbox library supports different persistence mecanisms: MailDir, Database (via JPA) and JCR.</p>
  
      <p>Mailbox persistence is configured in spring-beans.xml (by default JPA, 
         you set the database connection properties in database.properties - can also be 
         MailDir, JCR).</p>

    </subsection>
  
    <subsection name="Mail Repository Store Persistence">
  
      <p>Available Mail Repository Store are defined in mailrepositorystore.xml. 
         Each has an URL prefix (file, db, dbfile,...) that can be used in mailetcontainer.xml 
         to define where to store spam,... mails (example: file://var/mail/error/).</p>

      <p>More information about the mailstores configuration can be 
        found <a href="config-mailrepositorystore.html">here</a>.</p>
        
      <p>Mail Repository Stores are distinguished by how they store data. There are five types of 
        storage: File, Database, DBFile.</p>

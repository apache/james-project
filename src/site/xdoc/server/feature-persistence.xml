  <section name="Mailbox and Mail Repository Store for Mail Persistence">
  
    <subsection name="Introduction">
  
      <p>The <b>Mailbox</b> persists users' Inbox, Sent Items, Trash... folders with their mails.</p>
      
      <p>The <b>Mail Repository Store</b> persists  spam, error,... mails, so nothing to do with users visible mails.</p>
  
      <p>In case of database access, both Mailbox and Mail Repository Store use database connection defined via database.properties.</p>
      
    </subsection>

    <subsection name="Mailbox Persistence">
  
      <p>Apache James Server uses the <a href="http://james.apache.org/mailbox">Apache James Mailbox</a> storage system 
         to store the users mailboxes.</p>
  
      <p>The mailbox library supports different persistence mecanisms: MailDir, Database (via JPA) and JCR.</p>
  
      <p>Mailbox persistence is configured in spring-beans.xml (by default JPA, 
         you set the database connection properties in database.properties - can also be 
         MailDir, JCR).</p>

    </subsection>
  
    <subsection name="Mail Repository Store Persistence">

      <p>Mail repository allow the administrator to store mail being processed in the mailet-container. The mails are typically
      added by the <strong>ToRepository</strong> mailet. Then for Guice wiring <a href="manage-webadmin.html">webAdmin</a> API allows to read, delete and
      reprocess these mails.</p>

        <p>
          Typical use cases might be:
          <ul>
            <li>Error management: mails can be stored if an error is encountered during the mail processing, be the error caused by a bug,
                a configuration mistake, a parsing error, temporary unavailable services. Reprocessing the mails once the problem fixed allows to
                avoid data loss. Note that you can use mail repositories of different types on the same James server in order to not
                be dependant from a single data-store.</li>
            <li>Debugging: MDC context allows to follow mail processing, and isolate logs of a single mail. You can then configure
                James in order to collect all mails processed in one part of your pipeline, and thus better understand this one.</li>
            <li>Data collection: Collect spam, suspicious mails and much more. You can then later on analyze them or for instance train
                your anti-spam system.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
  
      <p>Available Mail Repository Store are defined in mailrepositorystore.xml. 
         Each has an URL prefix (file, db, dbfile,...) that can be used in mailetcontainer.xml 
         to define where to store spam,... mails (example: file://var/mail/error/).</p>

      <p>More information about the mailstores configuration can be 
        found <a href="config-mailrepositorystore.html">here</a>.</p>
        
      <p>Mail Repository Stores are distinguished by how they store data. There are five types of 
        storage: File, Database, DBFile.</p>

        <section name="Presentation">

            <p>James relies on the <a href="https://metrics.dropwizard.io/4.1.2/manual/core.html">Dropwizard metric library</a>
            for keeping track of some core metrics of James.</p>

            <p>Such metrics are made available via JMX. You can connect for instance using VisualVM and the associated
            mbean plugins.</p>

            <p>
                You can also export the metrics to ElasticSearch and visualize them with <a href="https://grafana.com/">Grafana</a>.
                See <a href="config-elasticsearch.html">elaticseach.properties</a> documentation for more details on how to set this up.

                In addition to these metrics, you can define your own metrics using the <b>Metrics</b> mailet. By adding
                it in your mailet container, you can count emails that pass via any points. You can also, using matchers,
                count emails that matches the conditions you defined.

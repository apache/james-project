            <p>Released October 2017</p>

            <p>The Apache James PMCs are glad to announce you the release
                version 3.0.1 of Apache James server.</p>

            <p>It fixes vulnerability described in CVE-2017-12628. The JMX server, also
                used by the command line client is exposed to a java de-serialization
                issue, and thus can be used to execute arbitrary commands. As James
                exposes JMX socket by default only on local-host, this vulnerability can
                only be used for privilege escalation.</p>

        <section name="Version 3.0.0">

            <p>Released July 2017</p>

            <p>The Apache James project is happy to announce the release
                of version 3.0.0 of its modular mail server.</p>

            <p>After a long work, the team is really proud to announce the new release, James 3.0.
                This new version of the Apache James Server introduces many new features, 
                like the IMAP protocol, 
                experimental Sieve support, 
                experimental JMAP support, 
                and new email storage back-ends.</p>

            <p>For the James 3.0 release, the team have been specifically committed to testing. 
                We care about unit testing in a Test Driven Development way. 
                We added many integration tests, using the Mail Protocol Tester suite, but also using various IMAP, SMTP and HTTP clients. 
                We conducted load testing campaigns, and developed tools based on Gatling, a load testing framework, for the JMAP, IMAP and SMTP protocols. 
                We introduced live metric collection and display in Grafana, as well as log collection in Kibana.</p>

        <section name="Version 3.0-M2 (Milestone 2)">

            <p>Released 09 November 2010</p>

            <p>The Java Apache Mail Enterprise Server (a.k.a. Apache James) Project is happy to announce
                the release of version 3.0-M2 (Milestone 2) of the Apache James server.</p>

            <p>M2 is not only a fast corrective release on M1 (issues related to JMX
                security configuration on Windows platforms,...), but also contains an important number
                of enhancement and JIRA fixes.</p>

            <p>For example, memory usage has been reduced thanks to optimizations on
                the ActiveMQ component usage (responsible for the mail spooling).</p>

            <p>We thank all Users for their feedback and tests and we encourage
                anyone to discover this Milestone 2 release.</p>

        <section name="Version 3.0-M1 (Milestone 1)">

            <p>Released 01 November 2010</p>

            <p>The Java Apache Mail Enterprise Server (a.k.a. Apache James) Project is happy to announce
                the release of version 3.0-M1 (Milestone 1) of the Apache James server.</p>

            <p>The Apache James Server is a 100% pure Java enterprise mail server based on open protocols.
                Currently supported are SMTP/LMTP, POP3, IMAP4 protocols together with several different
                storage solutions (relational database via JPA and JDBC, File system with MailDir, JCR Content Repsitory).</p>

            <p>The James server also serves as a mail application platform. It hosts the Apache Mailet API,
                and acts has a Mailet container. This feature makes it easy to design, write, and deploy custom applications for mail processing. This modularity and ease of customization is one of James' strengths, and can allow administrators to produce powerful applications surprisingly easily.</p>

            <p>Features for that version include enhancements to nearly every area of functionality,
                including full IMAP support, improved mailing list capabilities, fastfail support, SMTP API
                for developing own fastfail filters and the next revision of the Mailet API.</p>

            <p>This was an exciting time in James development and we thank all contributors.</p>

            <p>We are still actively looking for eager, capable developers to contribute to James.
                If you're interested in contributing to the James project, please subscribe to the James
                <a href="http://james.apache.org/mail.html">mailing lists</a>.</p>

            <p>Information about James can be found at the James web site
                at <a href="http://james.apache.org/">http://james.apache.org/</a>.</p>

            <p>Released 15 February 2006</p>
            <p>
                James 2.3.0a1 is "storage" compatible with 2.2.0 (It uses the same files/db formats of James 2.2.0). Configuration should be updated following this instructions. Mailets developed against 2.2.0 are not binary compatible with 2.3.0 but rebuilding mailets in 2.3.0a1 should be an easy task: just replace "Component"s with "Service"s and replace "MailStore" with "Store" and rebuild. Below are some highlights of features and changes already available:
                <ul>
                    <li>Phoenix container upgraded to the latest trunk: better classpath management for mailets</li>
                    <li>Derby support: also made it the default storage engine</li>
                    <li>JavaMail 1.3.2 (not JavaMail 1.3.3 because of known bugs with Base64 encoding)</li>
                    <li>Upgraded dependencies to the latest known stable releases (dnsjava, excalibur components, cornerstone, etc.)</li>
                    <li>Removed FetchPop</li>
                    <li>Command pattern for SMTPServer configuration (make it easier for developers to customize fastfail)</li>
                    <li>Increased components granularity/flexibility: many top level components have been refactored to be more modular (look at the new assembly.xml)</li>
                    <li>SMTP server now supports 8BITMIME, ENHANCEDSTATUSCODES, PIPELINING</li>
                    <li>Introduced a few experimental S/MIME and Bayesian matcher/mailets</li>
                    <li>Fixed more than 40 bugs against 2.2.0</li>
                    <li>And much more!</li>
                </ul>

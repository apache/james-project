  <title>Apache James Server 3 - Configuring the POP3 Service</title>
 </properties>

<body>

  <section name="POP3 Configuration">
  
    <p>Consult <a href="https://github.com/apache/james-project/tree/master/server/app/src/main/resources/pop3server.xml">pop3server.xml</a> in GIT to get some examples and hints.</p>

    <p>The POP3 service is controlled by a configuration block in the pop3server.xml.
       The pop3server tag defines the boundaries of the configuration block.  It encloses 
       all the relevant configuration for the POP3 server.  The behavior of the POP service is
       controlled by the attributes and children of this tag.</p>
    
    <p>This tag has an optional boolean attribute - <strong>enabled</strong> - that defines whether the service is active or not.  The value defaults to "true" if
       not present.</p>
    
    <p>The standard children of the pop3server tag are:</p>

      <dl>
        <dt><strong>bind</strong></dt>
        <dd>Configure this to bind to a specific inetaddress. This is an optional integer value.  This value is the port on which this POP3 server is configured 
      to listen. If the tag or value is absent then the service 
      will bind to all network interfaces for the machine If the tag or value is omitted, the value will default to the standard POP3 port, 11
    port 995 is the well-known/IANA registered port for POP3S  ie over SSL/TLS 
    port 110 is the well-known/IANA registered port for Standard POP3</dd>
        <dt><strong>connectionBacklog</strong></dt>
        <dd></dd>
        <dt><strong>tls</strong></dt>
        <dd>Set to true to support STARTTLS or SSL for the Socket.
         To use this you need to copy sunjce_provider.jar to /path/james/lib directory. To create a new keystore execute:
             keytool -genkey -alias james -keyalg RSA -keystore /path/to/james/conf/keystore<br/>
            Please note that each POP3 server exposed on different port can specify its own keystore, independently from any other
            TLS based protocols.</dd>
        <dt><strong>handler.helloName</strong></dt>
        <dd>This is the name used by the server to identify itself in the POP3 
        protocol.  If autodetect is TRUE, the server will discover its 
        own host name and use that in the protocol.  If discovery fails, 
        the value of 'localhost' is used.  If autodetect is FALSE, James 
        will use the specified value.</dd>
        <dt><strong>handler.connectiontimeout</strong></dt>
        <dd>Connection timeout in secconds</dd>
        <dt><strong>handler.connectionLimit</strong></dt>
        <dd>Set the maximum simultaneous incoming connections for this service</dd>
        <dt><strong>handler.connectionLimitPerIP</strong></dt>
        <dd>Set the maximum simultaneous incoming connections per IP for this service</dd>
        <dt><strong>handler.handlerchain</strong></dt>
        <dd>This loads the core CommandHandlers. Only remove this if you really 
             know what you are doing</dd>
      </dl>

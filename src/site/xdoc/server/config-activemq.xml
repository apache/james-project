    <title>Apache James Server 3 - ActiveMQ Configuration</title>
  </properties>

  <body>
    <section name="ActiveMQ Configuration">

      <p>Consult <a href="https://github.com/apache/james-project/blob/master/server/apps/cassandra-app/sample-configuration/activemq.properties">activemq.properties</a> in GIT to get some examples and hints.</p>

      <p>
        Use this configuration to configure ActiveMQ AQMP. It is only applicable with Guice products.
      </p>

    <section name="ActiveMQ Metrics Configuration">
      <p>
        ActiveMQ offers some metrics that are available via statistics plugin
        (see https://activemq.apache.org/statisticsplugin.html):
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Broker statistics: metrics about the broker itself such as <em>memoryUsage</em>,
          <em>maxEnqueueTime</em>, <em>consumerCount</em> etc. Those metrics can be used for
          monitoring and alerting (e.g. Prometheus).
        </li>
        <li>
          Queue statistics: For each created queue statistics will be collected, too. Usually,
          the queues <em>spool</em> and <em>outgoing</em> are available, but are not limited to.
          Having multiple RemoteDelivery mailets in place, then multiple <em>outgoing-*</em> queues
          can be available.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Basically, the metric collector sends an AQMP message to ActiveMQ requesting the statistics
        mentioned above. ActiveMQ responds with a message containing those statistics.
      </p>

      <p>
        Metrics Configuration
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt><strong>metrics.enabled</strong></dt>
        <dd>Enable collecting metrics (default: true)</dd>

        <dt><strong>metrics.start_delay (default: 1s, minimum: 1s)</strong></dt>
        <dd>Add a delay before starting collecting metrics on James' startup. You may increase this
          value if the embedded ActiveMQ takes long to start.</dd>

        <dt><strong>metrics.interval (default: 5s, minimum: 5s)</strong></dt>
        <dd>Define the interval how often the metrics should be collected.</dd>

        <dt><strong>metrics.timeout (default: 2s, minimum: 2s)</strong></dt>
        <dd>Timeout used by the collector to wait for an ActiveMQ response to arrive. This timeout is
        useful if the AQMP timeout (i.e. receive timeout) is not considered (see below).</dd>

        <dt><strong>metrics.aqmp_timeout (default: 1s, minimum: 1s)</strong></dt>
        <dd>AQMP timeout (i.e. receive timeout) used by the collector when sending an AQMP message.
          If the prefetch policy (ActiveMQ connection option) is zero, then the receive timeout is
          indefinite. Thus, the option <em>metrics.timeout</em> helps to have an additional timeout
          in place.
          <br />
          When James is not under heavy requesting and receiving statistics takes 50-80ms (mean).

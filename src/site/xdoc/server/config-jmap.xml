        <section name="JMAP configuration">

            <p><a href="https://jmap.io/">JMAP</a>  is intended to be a new standard for email clients to connect to mail
                stores. It therefore intends to primarily replace IMAP + SMTP submission. It is also designed to be more
                generic. It does not replace MTA-to-MTA SMTP transmission.</p>

            <p>Cassandra Guice proposes a JMAP implementation.</p>

            <subsection name="jmap.properties">

                <p>Consult <a href="https://github.com/apache/james-project/blob/master/dockerfiles/run/guice/cassandra/destination/conf/jmap.properties">jmap.properties</a> in GIT to get some examples and hints.</p>

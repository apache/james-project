  <section name="Performance">

    <p>James can spool more than 100 mails per second (configured with Maildir mail storage).</p>
    
    <p>We ran following command (from postfix distribution) with only 10 dequeue threads.</p>

    <source>time smtp-source -A -C1500 -l 100 -m 100000 -s 500 -d -c -f user@domain.net -t te localhost:25 100000</source>

    <p>The result was:</p>
    <ol> 
      <li>The queuing of the 100000 emails took 8 minutes.</li>
      <li>The dequeueing of the 100000 emails took 16 minutes.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>We thus have a throughput of more than <b>100 mails/second</b>.</p>

    <p>These numbers are obtained with the out-of-the-box configuration (not optimized).
       I you run for example (depends on JVM) with <code>-XX:+UseParallelGC -XX:+AggressiveOpts -XX:+UseFastAccessorMethods</code>,
       you may have 10000 mails enqueued in 38 seconds, which represents <b>263 mails per second</b>.</p>

            <p>
              Note: This feature requires Guice wiring. This is not implemented using Spring wiring.<br/>
              Additionally, wiring not providing a mailbox support, like <code>jpa-smtp</code>, do not have support for
              mailbox listeners configuration.
            </p>

            <p>Consult <a href="https://github.com/apache/james-project/blob/master/dockerfiles/run/guice/cassandra/destination/conf/listeners.xml">listeners.xml</a>
                to get some examples and hints.</p>

            <p>James Guice wiring allow the user to register potentially user defined additional mailbox listeners.</p>

            <p>To do so, just register the class that needs to be instantiated and added to global listeners. These JAR can be
               part of James source code, or provided as an extension and thus should be located in the<code>extensions-jars</code> folder.</p>

            <ul>
                Already provided additional listeners includes:

                 <li><code>org.apache.james.mailbox.spamassassin.SpamAssassinListener</code>:
                     Provides per user real-time HAM/SPAM feedback to a SpamAssassin server depending on user actions.
                     Please note that a <code>spamassassin.properties</code> file is needed.</li>
                 <li><code>org.apache.james.mailbox.cassandra.MailboxOperationLoggingListener</code>:
                     For Cassandra guice wiring. Provides more insights on mailbox operations</li>
                 <li><code>org.apache.james.mailbox.quota.mailing.listeners.QuotaThresholdCrossingListener</code>:
                     For Cassandra guice wiring. Sends emails to users exceeding 80% and 99% of their quota to warn them</li>
            </ul>

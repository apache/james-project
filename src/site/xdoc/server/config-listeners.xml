        <section name="Mailbox listeners configuration overview">

            <p>
              Note: This feature requires Guice wiring. This is not implemented using Spring wiring.<br/>
              Additionally, wiring not providing a mailbox support, like <code>jpa-smtp</code>, do not have support for
              mailbox listeners configuration.
            </p>

            <p>Consult <a href="https://github.com/apache/james-project/blob/master/dockerfiles/run/guice/cassandra/destination/conf/listeners.xml">listeners.xml</a>
                to get some examples and hints.</p>

            <p>James Guice wiring allow the user to register potentially user defined additional mailbox listeners.</p>

            <p>To do so, just register the class that needs to be instantiated and added to global listeners. These JAR can be
               part of James source code, or provided as an extension and thus should be located in the<code>extensions-jars</code> folder.</p>
        </section>

        <section name="MailboxListener configuration">
            <p>
                Mailbox listener configuration is under the XML element &lt;listener&gt;
            </p>
            <p>
                Some MailboxListener allows you to specify if you want to run them synchronously or asynchronously. To do so,
                for MailboxListener that supports this, you can use the <b>async</b> attribute (optional, per mailet default) to govern the execution mode.
                If <b>true</b> the execution will be scheduled in a reactor elastic scheduler. If <b>false</b>, the execution is synchronous.
            </p>

            <ul>
                Already provided additional listeners includes:

                 <li><code>org.apache.james.mailbox.spamassassin.SpamAssassinListener</code>:
                     Provides per user real-time HAM/SPAM feedback to a SpamAssassin server depending on user actions.
                     Please note that a <code>spamassassin.properties</code> file is needed.<br/>
                     This mailet is asynchronous by default, but this behaviour can be overridden by the <b>async</b>
                     configuration property.</li>
                 <li><code>org.apache.james.mailbox.cassandra.MailboxOperationLoggingListener</code>:
                     For Cassandra guice wiring. Provides more insights on mailbox operations</li>
                 <li><code>org.apache.james.mailbox.quota.mailing.listeners.QuotaThresholdCrossingListener</code>:
                     For Cassandra guice wiring. Sends emails to users exceeding 80% and 99% of their quota to warn them</li>
            </ul>

        <section name="PreDeletionHook configuration">
            <p>
                Before deleting a message in James, this message and some related information about the deletion will be passed to a set of PreDeletionHook instances,
                This process is called notifying, and it acts sequentially. If the notifying process for all PreDeletionHooks finish successfully, then the message will be processed to be deleted.
                Otherwise, that message won't be deleted.
            </p>
            <p>
                Pre Deletion Hook configuration is under the XML element &lt;preDeletionHook&gt;
            </p>
            <ul>
                Already provided additional pre deletion hooks includes:
                <li>
                    <code>org.apache.james.vault.DeletedMessageVaultHook</code>:
                    Storing messages about being deleted into <code>org.apache.james.vault.DeletedMessageVault</code>
                </li>

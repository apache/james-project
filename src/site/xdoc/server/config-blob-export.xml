      <p>Consult <a href="https://github.com/apache/james-project/blob/master/dockerfiles/run/guice/cassandra-rabbitmq/destination/conf/blob.properties">blob.properties</a> in GIT to get some examples and hints.</p>

      <subsection name="Local File Blob Export Configuration">
          <p>
              For each request, this mechanism retrieves the content of a blob and save it to a distinct local file, then send an email containing the absolute path of that file to the target mail address.
              Note: that absolute file path is the file location on James server. Therefore, if there are two or more James servers connected, it should not be considered an option.

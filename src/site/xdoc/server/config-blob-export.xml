  <section name="Blob Export Configuration">

      <p>
          Blob Exporting is the mechanism to help James to export a blob from an user to another user.
          It is commonly used to export deleted messages (consult <a href="/server/config-vault">configuring deleted messages vault</a>).
          The deleted messages are transformed into a blob and James will export that blob to the target user.

          This configuration helps you choose the blob exporting mechanism fit with your James setup and it is only applicable with Guice products.
      </p>

      <p>Consult <a href="https://github.com/apache/james-project/blob/master/server/apps/distributed-app/sample-configuration/blob.properties">blob.properties</a> in GIT to get some examples and hints.</p>

      <p>
          Configuration for exporting blob content
      </p>
      <dl>
          <dt><strong>blob.export.implementation</strong></dt>
          <dd>localFile: Local File Exporting Mechanism (explained below). Default: localFile</dd>
          <dd>linshare: LinShare Exporting Mechanism (explained below)</dd>
      </dl>

      <subsection name="Local File Blob Export Configuration">
          <p>
              For each request, this mechanism retrieves the content of a blob and save it to a distinct local file, then send an email containing the absolute path of that file to the target mail address.
              Note: that absolute file path is the file location on James server. Therefore, if there are two or more James servers connected, it should not be considered an option.
          </p>
          <dl>
              <dt><strong>blob.export.localFile.directory</strong></dt>
              <dd>
                  The directory URL to store exported blob data in files, and the URL following
                  <a href="http://james.apache.org/server/3/apidocs/org/apache/james/filesystem/api/FileSystem.html">James File System scheme</a>.
                  Default: file://var/blobExporting
              </dd>
          </dl>
      </subsection>
      <subsection name="LinShare Blob Export Configuration">
          <p>
              Instead of exporting blobs in local file system, using <a href="https://www.linshare.org">LinShare</a> helps you upload your blobs and people
              you have been shared to can access those blobs by accessing to LinShare server and download them.

              This way helps you to share via whole network as long as they can access to LinShare server.

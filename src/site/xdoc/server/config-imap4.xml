  <title>Apache James Server 3 - IMAP4 Configuration</title>
 </properties>

<body>

<section name="IMAP4 Configuration">

      <p>Consult <a href="https://github.com/apache/james-project/tree/master/server/app/src/main/resources/imapserver.xml">imapserver.xml</a> in GIT to get some examples and hints.</p>

    <p>The IMAP4 service is controlled by a configuration block in the imap4server.xml.
       The imap4server tag defines the boundaries of the configuration block.  It encloses 
       all the relevant configuration for the IMAP4 server.  The behavior of the IMAP4 service is
       controlled by the attributes and children of this tag.</p>
    
    <p>This tag has an optional boolean attribute - <strong>enabled</strong> - that defines whether the service is active or not.  The value defaults to "true" if
       not present.</p>
    
    <p>The standard children of the imapserver tag are:</p>

      <dl>
        <dt><strong>bind</strong></dt>
        <dd>Configure this to bind to a specific inetaddress. This is an optional integer value.  This value is the port on which this IMAP4 server is configured 
      to listen. If the tag or value is absent then the service 
      will bind to all network interfaces for the machine If the tag or value is omitted, the value will default to the standard IMAP4 port
      port 143 is the well-known/IANA registered port for IMAP 
     port 993 is the well-known/IANA registered port for IMAPS  ie over SSL/TLS</dd>
        <dt><strong>connectionBacklog</strong></dt>
        <dd></dd>
        <dt><strong>compress</strong></dt>
        <dd>true or false - Use or don't use COMPRESS extension.</dd>
        <dt><strong>maxLineLength</strong></dt>
        <dd>Maximal allowed line-length before a BAD response will get returned to the client
            This should be set with caution as a to high value can make the server a target for DOS (Denial of Service)!</dd>
        <dt><strong>inMemorySizeLimit</strong></dt>
        <dd>10MB size limit before we will start to stream to a temporary file</dd>
        <dt><strong>tls</strong></dt>
        <dd>Set to true to support STARTTLS or SSL for the Socket.
         To use this you need to copy sunjce_provider.jar to /path/james/lib directory. To create a new keystore execute:
             keytool -genkey -alias james -keyalg RSA -keystore /path/to/james/conf/keystore</dd>
        <dt><strong>handler.helloName</strong></dt>
        <dd>This is the name used by the server to identify itself in the IMAP4 
        protocol.  If autodetect is TRUE, the server will discover its 
        own host name and use that in the protocol.  If discovery fails, 
        the value of 'localhost' is used.  If autodetect is FALSE, James 
        will use the specified value.</dd>
        <dt><strong>handler.connectiontimeout</strong></dt>
        <dd>Connection timeout in secconds</dd>
        <dt><strong>handler.connectionLimit</strong></dt>
        <dd>Set the maximum simultaneous incoming connections for this service</dd>
        <dt><strong>handler.connectionLimitPerIP</strong></dt>
        <dd>Set the maximum simultaneous incoming connections per IP for this service</dd>
        <dt><strong>handler.handlerchain</strong></dt>
        <dd>This loads the core CommandHandlers. Only remove this if you really 
             know what you are doing</dd>
      </dl>

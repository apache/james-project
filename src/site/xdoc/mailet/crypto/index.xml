                This software uses cryptographic API. The country in
                which you currently reside may have restrictions on the import,
                possession, use, and/or re-export to another country, of
                encryption software. BEFORE using any encryption software, please
                check your country's laws, regulations and policies concerning the
                import, possession, or use, and re-export of encryption software, to
                see if this is permitted. See

                The U.S. Government Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and
                Security (BIS), has classified this software as Export Commodity
                Control Number (ECCN) 5D002.C.1, which includes information security
                software using or performing cryptographic functions with asymmetric
                algorithms. The form and manner of this Apache Software Foundation
                distribution makes it eligible for export under the License Exception
                ENC Technology Software Unrestricted (TSU) exception (see the BIS
                Export Administration Regulations, Section 740.13) for both object

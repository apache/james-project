  <title>James 2.3 - Release Announcement</title>
 </properties>
<body>
<section name="Release Announcement">
<p>The Java Apache Mail Enterprise Server (a.k.a. Apache James) Project is happy to announce the release 
of version 2.3 of the Apache James server.</p>

<p>James is a 100% pure Java Mail and News server designed to be a complete and portable enterprise 
mail engine solution.  James supports currently available IETF protocols, including SMTP,POP3 and NNTP 
, and it and IMAP are targeted for full functionality in v3).  James 
is able to store user and message data either in a file-system or a JDBC-compatible database, 
allowing fast, reliable, even real-time replicated storage.</p>

<p>James provides a powerful, flexible mail application engine through support for the Apache Mailet 
API.  With its Mailet pipeline architecture, James can be used not only to provide standard e-mail 
services, but also to implement custom e-mail applications.</p>

<p>The James mail server is deployed in production environments and has proven itself to be a robust 
and high performance mail solution.  Tests indicate that version 2.3 is able to maintain a constant 
mail throughput rate of thousands of messages/minute for continuous periods.</p>

<p>The James Community is also happy to announce the beginning of the design phase for James version 
3.0.  Features tentatively slated for that version include enhancements to nearly every area of 
functionality, including full IMAP support, improved mailing list capabilities, fastfail support, 
smtp-api for developing own fastfail filters and the next revision of the Mailet API.  This is expected
to be an exciting time in James development.  We are actively 
looking for eager, capable developers to contribute to James.  If you're interesting in contributing 
to the James project, please subscribe to the James developer mailing list.</p>

<p>
The <a href='main'>main library</a> contains the basic frameworks suitable
for creating <a href='http://www.junit.org' rel='tag'>JUnit</a> tests and
for creating standalone tests suitable for independent execution. This contains 
a lightweight scripting framework suitable for the
functional testing of the ASCII line based protocols common in mail.
The script contains a list of client sends and templated server
responses. The framework runs the client lines against a host system
and then compares the server lines received in response against the
templates (which may include regex's and so on).
</p><p>
The <a href='antlib'>AntLib</a> module extends the standalone framework
to create functional testing tasks suitable for execution against a 
independently running server.
</p>
<p>
The <a href='app'>Application</a> module provides an executable interface
for MPT.

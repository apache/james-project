# 1. [JAMES-2909] Record architecture decisions

Date: 2019-10-02

## Status

Proposed

## Context

In order to be more community-oriented, we should adopt a process to have a structured way to have open architectural decisions.

Using an Architectural Decision Records-based process as a support of discussion on the developers mailing-lists.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records, as [described by Michael Nygard](https://web.archive.org/web/20190824074401/http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).

Each ADR will be discussed on the Apache James' developers mailing-list before being accepted.

## Consequences

See Michael Nygard's article, linked above. For a lightweight ADR toolset, see Nat Pryce's [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools).

James JSieve 0.7 has been released.

The library is available as a maven artifact, for instance for jsieve core:

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.james</groupId>
    <artifactId>apache-jsieve-core</artifactId>
    <version>0.7</version>
</dependency>
```

This release solves issues with folded encoded header matching.

It also adds an additional DiscardAction to make discarding emails explicit for the calling code.

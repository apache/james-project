The Apache James PMCs are glad to announce you the release
version 3.0.1 of Apache James server.

It fixes vulnerability described in CVE-2017-12628. The JMX server, also
used by the command line client is exposed to a java de-serialization
issue, and thus can be used to execute arbitrary commands. As James
exposes JMX socket by default only on local-host, this vulnerability can
only be used for privilege escalation.

Release 3.0.1 upgrades the incriminated library.

Note that you can take additional defensive steps in order to mitigate this vulnerability:

 - Ensure that you restrict the access to JMX only on local-host
 - Ensure that you are using a recent Java Run-time Environment. For instance OpenJDK 8 u111 is vulnerable but OpenJDK 8 u 141 is not.
 - You can additionally run James in a container to limit damages of potential exploits
 - And of course upgrade to the newest 3.0.1 version.

We are actively working on implementing JMAP protocol into James.

[JMAP][JMAP] is a transport-agnostic, stateless JSON-based API for synchronising a mail client with a mail server.

It allows to develop easily a mail client in a browser, without the pain of using a server to proxy IMAP commands.

Feel free to help us, you can see our advancement on the specification implementation into [jmap/doc][doc]

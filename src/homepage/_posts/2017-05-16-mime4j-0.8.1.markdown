James Mime4J 0.8.1 has been released.

The library is available as a maven artifact, for instance for mime4j core:

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.james</groupId>
    <artifactId>apache-mime4j-core</artifactId>
    <version>0.8.1</version>
</dependency>
```

This release solves issues with header Date handling in the dom project:

 - It was not possible to know if the Date header was set as a default value was always provided
 - Valid dates missing century was badly parsed.

                </header>

                <p>
                    This document will present how to set up a James server in order to serve as a personal IMAP + SMTP
                    server. We will cover:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>DNS resolution and essential DNS records for mail delivery</li>
                    <li>Server components description</li>
                    <li>Generation of a custom keystore</li>
                    <li>Starting James</li>
                    <li>Basic James administration</li>
                    <li>Additional features one might want to enable...</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    This guide rely on the JPA Guice Docker image. To run it, one need to have docker installed.
                </p>

                <header class="major">
                    <h2><b>DNS resolution</b></h2>
                </header>

                <p>
                    For a public facing mail server to send and receive mail properly, 
                    it is necessary to configure your public DNS records so that other mailservers can find and send mail to your users, 
                    and for other mailservers to trust and receive your mail.
                </p>
                <header class="major">
                    <h2><b>MX Record</b></h2>
                </header>

                <p>
                    Someone willing to send you an email will first have to discover which IP your mail server has.
                    The way this is achieved is through MX (means Mail eXchange) DNS record.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Imagine bob@domain.org sends a mail to alice@company.com. Bob will:
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Ask <code>company.com</code> DNS server its MX entries</li>
                    <li><code>company.com</code> respond that it is <code>mx.company.com</code></li>
                    <li>Bob resolves <code>mx.company.com</code> ip address...</li>
                    <li>...and can establish a connection to <code>mx.company.com</code> to send an email to Alice</li>
                </ol>

                <p>All you need is to create a MX Record in your Domain Control Panel and point it to the IP of your James server.</p>

                <header class="major">
                    <h2><b>PTR Record</b></h2>
                </header>

                <p>
                    So you want to send an email to friends in another domain. 
                    Their mailserver will not trust mail coming from your server unless they can do a reverse DNS lookup.
                </p>

                <p>That is what PTR Record do - A reverse lookup which maps the mailserver IP address to domain name.</p>
                <p>PTR Record can only be created by your ISP - So don't hesitate to ask them to create it for you.</p>

                    <h2><b>JAMES architecture</b></h2>
                </header>

                <p>JPA guice docker image relies on an embedded Derby database for storing data. Note that Apache Lucene library
                    is used for email search. A mail queue is implemented on top of an embedded Apache ActiveMQ. Hence James do not need
                    any external service for being running.
                </p>

                <img src="/images/guice-jpa-architecture-overview.png">

                <p>
                    JPA guice offers the following protocols:
                </p>

                <ul class="no-padding">
                    <li><b>SMTP</b> For receiving emails</li>
                    <li><b>IMAP</b> For reading emails</li>

                <ul class="no-padding">
                    <li><b>LMTP</b> local version of SMTP</li>

                    <h2><b>Generation of a custom keystore</b></h2>
                </header>

                <p>In order to maintain a good level of privacy and security, James is relying on TLS cryptography
                for securing exchanges. We thus need to generate our own personal keystore. Note that this guide do not
                cover generating a keystore from SSL certificates. A security exception might be configured on the Mail
                User Agent.</p>

                <p>In order to create a keystore, please run: <code>keytool -genkey -alias james -keyalg RSA -keystore /path/to/james/conf/keystore</code>.
                James is configured with a default password <code>james72laBalle</code> (used to read the keystore). However, we will be overriding the
                configuration of the docker image, so you can be defining your own.</p>

                <header class="major">
                    <h2><b>Starting james</b></h2>
                </header>

                <p>We want to override the configuration of the docker image with a volume.</p>

                <p>First let's retrieve a valid configuration:</p>

                <pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/apache/james-project
$ cp -rf james-project/server/apps/jpa-app/sample-configuration conf
$ mv keystore conf/keystore</code></pre>

                <p>Modify all protocol configuration files to match your keystore password (imapserver.xml, lmtpserver.xml, managesieveserver.xml, pop3server.xml, smtpserver.xml).</p>

                <p>We will create a local folder for holding data out of the container:</p>

                <pre><code>mkdir var</code></pre>


                <p>Then, let's start James:</p>

                <pre><code>docker run \
--name james_run \
-p "25:25" -p "465:465" -p "587:587" \
-p "143:143"  -p "993:993" \
--volume "$PWD/conf:/root/conf/" \
--volume "$PWD/var:/root/var/" \
linagora/james-jpa-guice:latest</code></pre>


                <header class="major">
                    <h2><b>Administrating James</b></h2>
                </header>

                <p>We now have a running James server. We just need to tell him which users and domains it should be handling mails for.
                We will, in order to do this, use the command line:</p>

                <pre><code>docker exec james_run java -jar /root/james-cli.jar AddDomain domain.tld
docker exec james_run java -jar /root/james-cli.jar AddUser user@domain.tld secretPassword</code></pre>

                <p>The command line client can be used for several other purposes like managing quota, setting addresses redirections, etc.</p>

                    <h2><b>Configuring thunderbird</b></h2>
                </header>

                <p>Given that the domain <b>james.local</b> is created and that user <b>user01@james.local</b> have password <b>1234</b>
                    (which is the setup of the demo image), we will configure thunderbird (here version 78.11.0).</p>

                <p>First go to the <i>Account setting</i> page and click on <i>Add mail account</i>.</p> <br/>

                <img src="/images/tb1.png"/>

                <p>Then document the IP, and ports, username credentials and account name, through the advanced configuration. Note that
                    the username should include the domain. We recommend using SSL ports for IMAP and SMTP.</p>

                <img src="/images/tb2.png"/>

                <p>Review your accounting settings, especially be careful to pick the right outgoing server...</p>

                <img src="/images/tb3-5.png">

                <p>If you are relying on self signed certificate, you might be prompted to confirm a security exception. Accept.</p>

                <p>You can then enjoy this Thunderbird account!</p>

  <title>James 2.1 - Provided Matchers</title>
 </properties>

<body>

<section name="Matchers">

<p>James provides a number of implemented Matchers for use by James administrators in their 
configurations.  These are primarily matchers that members of the James developer or user 
communities have found useful in their own configurations.  A description of how to configure 
Matchers and use them in the James SpoolManager can be found <a href="spoolmanager_configuration_2_1.html">here</a>.</p>

<subsection name="All">
<p>Description: This matcher is the trivial one - it matches all mails being processed.  All recipients are returned.</p>
<p>Configuration string: None.</p>
</subsection>
<subsection name="AttachmentFileNameIs">
<p>Description: It can be used to refuse emails with SCR, PIF, EXE etc. attachments.
It matches mails that has a file attachment with a file name meeting one of the supplied filters.
All recipients are returned.</p>
<p>Configuration string: A comma or space delimited list of file names. 
File names may start with a wildcard '*'. Example: *.scr,*.bat,*.pif,*.pi,*.com,*.exe</p>
</subsection>
<subsection name="CommandForListserv">
<p>Description: The CommandForListserv matcher is used as a simple filter to recognize emails that are list server 
commands.  It will match any email addressed to the list server host, as well as any email that is addressed
to a user named &lt;prefix&gt;-on or &lt;prefix&gt;-off on any host.  Only those matching recipients will be returned.</p>
<p>Configuration string: An email address of the form &lt;prefix&gt;@&lt;host&gt;, where host is the hostname used for the listserver and prefix is the command prefix.</p>
</subsection>
<subsection name="FetchedFrom">
<p>Description: A matcher intended for use with the FetchPOP server.  It matches a custom header (X-fetched-from) that is 
set by the FetchPOP server.  FetchPOP sets this header to the name of the FetchPOP task which originally fetched
the message.  All recipients are returned.</p>
<p>Configuration string: The name of the FetchPOP task which originally fetched the message.</p>
</subsection>
<subsection name="HasAttachment">

<p>Description: Matches mails that have the specified Mail Attribute and the
specified MailAttribute value. All recipients are returned.</p>

representation of the Mail Attribute value for matching. The 
String.equals(String) method tests for a match.</p>

and then the String value to be matched. For example:<br/>
<pre><code>
&lt;mailet match="HasMailAttributeWithValue=name, value" class=&quot;&lt;any-class&gt;&quot;&gt;

        <section name="Mailbox JPA Responsibility">
            <p> This mailbox implementation stores messages in a Java Persistence API store 
            (think data bases, but not limited to that). 
            </p>
            <p>
                Default JPA provider is 
                <a href="http://openjpa.apache.org/">Apache OpenJPA</a>, 
                but you can roll your own by extending JPAMailboxManager and JPAMessageManager in the same way
                as OpenJPAMailboxManager and OpenJPAMessageManager do. 
            </p>

        <section name="Overview">
            <p>The JPA implementation uses Java Persistenca API Annotations to map Java objects to data base tables. 
            The current implementation also supports features such as storing messages in an encrypted database and provide 
            on the fly encryption/decryption.

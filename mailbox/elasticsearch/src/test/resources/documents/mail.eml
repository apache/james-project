Hi all,

An update between the 17th of May and the 1st of June seems to have broken
Inkscape's ability to open existing svg files on my computer. Any svg I
open (including stock files off the internet) cause Inkscape to crash with
"Inkscape encountered an internal error and will close now". I even created
a new, test svg consisting only of a few shapes and text, but I can't open
it again after saving. Has anyone else seen anything like this?

Thanks!

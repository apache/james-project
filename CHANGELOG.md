### Removed
 - HybridBlobStore. Introduced to fasten small blob access, its usage could be
 compared to a cache, but with a sub-optimal implementation (no eviction, default replication factor, no  circuit breaking).
 Use BlobStore cache instead.
 
### Performance
- JAMES-3295 Multiple IMAP performance enhancements for the Distributed Server. Some enhancement might transfer to other servers as well.
  - JAMES-3295 Use MessageManager::listMessagesMetadata more widely (IMAP)
  - JAMES-3265 IMAP FETCH reading lastUid and lastModseq should be optional
  - JAMES-3265 CassandraMessageMapper should limit modseq allocation upon flags updates
  - JAMES-3265 Impement a MessageMapper method to reset all recents
- JAMES-3263 Optimize RecipientRewriteTable::getMappingsForType
- JAMES-3458 Limit Cassandra statements when retrieving all quota limits
- JAMES-2037 CassandraMessageMapper::listAllMessageUids should not rely on ComposedMessageIdWithMetaData
- JAMES-3453 Specify explicitly lower safer defaults for Reactor flatMaps, filterWhens
- JAMES-3444 Allow moving JMAP mailets in a local-delivery processor - this enables calling `RecipientIsLocal` only one time in the mailet processing pipeline.
- JAMES-2037 Use Flux for MessageManager::search
- JAMES-3409 Better denormalize mailboxes within the Distributed Server. This enables reading only one table of the projection instead of two. Read repairs are implemented for keeping eventual consistency checks. Read upgrade instructions.
- JAMES-3433 Distributed Server: use caching blobstore only for frequently accessed data (callers can specify the level of performance they expect). This ensures the cache is read when it is useful.
- JAMES-3408 Limit concurrency when retrieving mailbox counters
- JAMES-3430 Restructure message properties storage within Cassandra Mailbox. See upgrade instructions.
- JAMES-3277 SetMessagesUpdateProcessor should read less mailboxes - enhance performance for JMAP-draft and JMAP RFC-8621.
- JAMES-3408 Enforce IMAP List not reading counters for Distributed James
- JAMES-3377 Remove unused text criterion - newly indexed mails indexed in ElasticSearch will take less space
- JAMES-3095 Avoid listing all subscriptions for each mailbox (IMAP)
- JAMES-2629 Use a future supplier in CassandraAsyncExecutor
- JAMES-2904 Avoid loading attachment when not needed (IMAP & JMAP) + attachment content streaming (JMAP)
- JAMES-3155 Limit the number of flags updated at the same time
- JAMES-3264 MAILBOX details are read 3 times upon indexing
- JAMES-3506 Avoid a full body read within VacationMailet
- JAMES-3508 Improved performance for IMAP APPEND
- JAMES-3506 SMTP performance enhancement
- JAMES-3505 Make mail remote delivery multi-threaded
- JAMES-3488 Support TLS 1.3
- JAMES-3484 Cassandra mailbox should group copies/moves

### Third party softwares
- James is no longer tested against Cassandra 3.11.3 but instead against Cassandra 3.11.10. Users are recommended to upgrade to this
version as well. See related upgrade instructions.

## [3.5.0] - 2020-04-06

### Added
- JAMES-2813 task management for Distributed James product. This enables several James servers to share a consistent view
of tasks being currently executed.
- JAMES-2563 Health check for ElasticSearch
- JAMES-2904 Authentication and SSL support for Cassandra backend
- JAMES-2904 Authentication and SSL support for ElasticSearch backend

### Changed
  - Use of routing keys to collocate documents per mailbox
  - Under some configuration, html was not extracted before document indexing
  - Removed unnecessary fields from mailbox mapping
  - Disable dynamic mapping thanks to a change of the header structure
- Multiple changes have been made to enhance Distributed James indexing performance:
  - JAMES-2917 Use of routing keys to collocate documents per mailbox
  - JAMES-2910 Under some configuration, html was not extracted before document indexing
  - JAMES-2079 Removed unnecessary fields from mailbox mapping
  - JAMES-2078 Disable dynamic mapping thanks to a change of the header structure
  - Read related [upgrade instructions](upgrade-instructions.md)
- JAMES-2855 Multiple library/plugin/docker images/build tool upgrades
- JAMES-2981 By default the cassandra keyspace creation by James is now disabled by default. This allow to have credentials limited to a keyspace. It can be enabled by setting cassandra.keyspace.create=true in the cassandra.properties file.
- Usernames are assumed to be always lower cased. Many users recently complained about mails non received when sending to upper cased local recipients. We decided to simplify the handling of case for local recipients and users by always storing them lower cased.
- JAMES-2576 Unhealthy health checks now return HTTP 503 instead of 500, degraded now returns 200 instead of 500. See JAMES-2576.
- JAMES-2992 In order to fasten JMAP-draft message retrieval upon calls on properties expected to be fast to fetch, we now compute the preview and hasAttachment properties asynchronously and persist them in Cassandra to improve performance. See JAMES-2919.
- JAMES-2950 It is now forbidden to create new Usernames with the following set of characters in its local part : `"(),:; <>@\[]`, as we prefer it to stay simple to handle. However, the read of Usernames already existing with some of those characters is still allowed, to not introduce any breaking change. See JAMES-2950.
- JAMES-3040 Linshare blob export configuration and mechanism change.
- JAMES-3112 Differentiation between domain alias and domain mapping. Read upgrade instructions.
- JAMES-3122 Log4J2 adoption for Spring product. Log file configuration needs to be updated. See upgrade instructions.

### Removed
- Classes marked as deprecated whose removal was planned after 3.4.0 release (See JAMES-2703). This includes:
  - SieveDefaultRepository. Please use SieveFileRepository instead.
  - JDBCRecipientRewriteTable, XMLRecipientRewriteTable, UsersRepositoryAliasingForwarding, JDBCAlias mailets. Please use RecipientRewriteTable mailet instead.
  - JDBCRecipientRewriteTable implementation. Please use JPARecipientRewriteTable instead.
  - JamesUsersJdbcRepository, DefaultUsersJdbcRepository. Please use JpaUsersRepository instead.
  - MailboxQuotaFixed matcher. Please use IsOverQuota instead.
- UsersFileRepository, which was marked as deprecated for years
  - We accordingly removed deprecated methods within UsersRepositoryManagementMBean exposed over JMX (unsetAlias, getAlias, unsetForwardAddress, getForwardAddress). RecipientRewriteTables should be used instead.
- JAMES-3016 RemoteDelivery now doesn't enable `allow8bitmime` property by default. 
This parameter could cause body content alteration leading to DKIM invalid DKIM signatures to be positioned. 
Thanks to Sergey B. for the report. 
More details about the property is at [java mail doc](https://javaee.github.io/javamail/docs/api/com/sun/mail/smtp/package-summary.html)
 - JAMES-3122 LogEnabled API in Spring product had been removed for Log4J2 adoption for Java 9+ runtime compatibility.
 - JAMES-3122 LogEnabled API in Spring product had been removed for Log4J2 adoption for Java 9+ runtime compatibility. 
 - HybridBlobStore. This will be removed after 3.6.0 release. Introduced to fasten small blob access, its usage could be
 compared to a cache, but with a sub-optimal implementation (no eviction, default replication factor, no  circuit breaking).
 Use BlobStore cache instead.

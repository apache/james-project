  - Use of routing keys to collocate documents per mailbox
  - Under some configuration, html was not extracted before document indexing
  - Removed unnecessary fields from mailbox mapping
  - Disable dynamic mapping thanks to a change of the header structure 
  - Read related [upgrade instructions](upgrade-instructions.md)

### Removed
- Classes marked as deprecated whose removal was planned after 3.4.0 release (See JAMES-2703). This includes:
  - SieveDefaultRepository. Please use SieveFileRepository instead.
  - JDBCRecipientRewriteTable, XMLRecipientRewriteTable, UsersRepositoryAliasingForwarding, JDBCAlias mailets. Please use RecipientRewriteTable mailet instead.
  - JDBCRecipientRewriteTable implementation. Please use JPARecipientRewriteTable instead.
  - JamesUsersJdbcRepository, DefaultUsersJdbcRepository. Please use JpaUsersRepository instead.
  - MailboxQuotaFixed matcher. Please use IsOverQuota instead.
- UsersFileRepository, which was marked as deprecated for years

### Third party softwares

## [3.4.0] - 2019-09-05
### Added
- Add in-memory docker image
- Support of AWS S3 as blobstore

- Blob export to LinShare
- Native DKIM support for outgoing mails. The mailets from james-jdkim have been included in main James project.

### Deprecated

### Removed
- Karaf OSGi implementation. It was not compiled nor tested for a year. We didn't get any feedback about that and we don't have the resources nor the skills to maintain it any more.

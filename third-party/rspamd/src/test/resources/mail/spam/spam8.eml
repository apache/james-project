If you are like many people, you are not even sure what a<BR>
Money Judgment is and </FONT>
<FONT color=3D"#0000A0"> why processing Money Judgments<BR>
can earn you very substantial income</FONT>
<FONT color=3D"#000000">  .<BR>
<BR>
If you ever sue a company or a person and you win then you<BR>
will have a Money Judgment against them.<BR>
<BR>
You are happy you won but you will soon find out the<BR>
shocking fact: "Its now up to you to collect on the<BR>
Judgment". The court does not require the loser to pay you.<BR>
The court will not even help you. You must trace the loser<BR>
down, find their assets, their employment, bank accounts,<BR>
real estate, stocks and bonds, etc.<BR>
<BR>
Very few people know how to find these assets or what to do<BR>
when they are found. The result is that millions of<BR>
Judgments are just sitting in files and being forgotten.<BR>
<BR>
"In 79% of the cases the winner of a Judgment never sees a<BR>
dime."<BR>
<BR>
The non-payment of judicial debt has grown to epidemic<BR>
proportions. Right now in the United States there is<BR>
between </FONT>
<FONT color=3D"#0000A0"> 200 and 300 billion dollars of uncollected Money<=
BR>
Judgment debt</FONT>
<FONT color=3D"#000000">  . For every Judgment that is paid, 5 more<BR>
Judgments take its place.<BR>
<BR>
We identified this massive market 8 years ago and have<BR>
actively pursued Judicial Judgments since. We invented this<BR>
business. We have perfected it into a well proven and solid<BR>
profession in which only a select few will be trained in the<BR>
techniques necessary to succeed.<BR>
<BR>
With our first hand experience we have built a course which<BR>
teaches you how to start your business in this new unknown<BR>
and exciting field of processing Money Judgments.<BR>
<BR>
By following the steps laid out in our course and with<BR>
reasonable effort you can become very successful in the<BR>
processing of Money Judgments.<BR>
<BR>
The income potential is substantial in this profession. </FONT>
<FONT color=3D"#0000A0"> We<BR>
have associates who have taken our course and are now<BR>
working full time making $96,000.00 to over $200,000.00 per<BR>
year. Part time associates are earning between $24,000.00<BR>
and $100,000.00 per year </FONT>
<FONT color=3D"#000000"> . Some choose to operate out of<BR>
their home and work by themselves. Others build a sizable<BR>
organization of 15 to 25 people in attractive business<BR>
offices.<BR>
<BR>
Today our company and our associates have over 126<BR>
million dollars in Money Judgments that we are currently<BR>
processing. Of this 126 million, 25 million is in the form<BR>
of joint ventures between our firm and our associates.<BR>
Joint ventures are where we make our money. We only break<BR>
even when our course is purchased. We make a 12% margin on<BR>
the reports we supply to our associates. Our reporting<BR>
capability is so extensive that government agencies, police<BR>
officers, attorneys, credit agencies etc., all come to us<BR>
for reports.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Many of our associates already have real estate liens in<BR>
force of between 5 million to over 15 million dollars.<BR>
Legally this means that when the properties are sold or<BR>
refinanced our associate must be paid off. The norm is 10%<BR>
interest compounded annually on unpaid Money Judgments.<BR>
Annual interest on 5 million at 10% translates to<BR>
$500,000.00 annually in interest income, not counting the<BR>
payment of the principal.<BR>
<BR>
Our associates earn half of this amount or $250,000.00 per<BR>
year. This is just for interest, not counting principle<BR>
and not counting the compounding of the interest which can<BR>
add substantial additional income. Typically companies are<BR>
sold for 10 times earnings. Just based on simple interest<BR>
an associate with 5 million in real estate liens could sell<BR>
their business for approximately 2.5 million dollars.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<FONT color=3D"#0000A0"> 92% of all of our associates work out of their ho=
me; 43%<BR>
are women and 36% are part time</FONT>
<FONT color=3D"#000000">  .<BR>
<BR>
One of the benefits of working in this field is that you are<BR>
not under any kind of time frame. If you decide to take off<BR>
for a month on vacation then go. The Judgments you are<BR>
working on will be there when you return. The Judgments<BR>
are still in force, they do not disappear.<BR>
<BR>
The way we train you is non-confrontational. You use your<BR>
computer and telephone to do most of the processing. You<BR>
never confront the debtor. The debtor doesn't know who you<BR>
are. You are not a collection agency.<BR>
<BR>
Simply stated the steps to successful Money Processing<BR>
are as follows:<BR>
<BR>
Mail our recommended letter to companies and individuals<BR>
with Money Judgments. (We train you how to find out who<BR>
to write to)<BR>
<BR>
8% to 11% of the firms and people you write will call you<BR>
and ask for your help. They call you, you don't call them<BR>
unless you want to.<BR>
<BR>
You send them an agreement (supplied in the course) to<BR>
sign which splits every dollar you collect 50% to you and<BR>
50% to them. This applies no matter if the judgment is for<BR>
$2,000.00 or $2,000,000.00.<BR>
<BR>
You then go on-line to our computers to find the debtor<BR>
and their assets. We offer over 120 powerful reports to<BR>
assist you. They range from credit reports from all three<BR>
credit bureaus, to bank account locates, employment<BR>
locates, skip traces and locating stocks and bonds, etc.<BR>
The prices of our reports are very low. Typically 1/2 to<BR>
1/3 of what other firms charge. For example we charge<BR>
$6.00 for an individuals credit report when some other<BR>
companies charge $25.00.<BR>
<BR>
Once you find the debtor and their assets you file<BR>
garnishments and liens on the assets you have located.<BR>
(Standard fill in the blanks forms are included in the<BR>
course)<BR>
<BR>
When you receive the assets you keep 50% and send 50% to<BR>
the original Judgment holder.<BR>
<BR>
Once the Judgment is fully paid you mail a Satisfaction of<BR>
Judgment to the court. (Included in the course)<BR>
<BR>
Quote's from several of our students:<BR>
<BR>
Thomas in area code 516 writes us: "I just wanted to drop<BR>
you a short note thanking you for your excellent course. </FONT>
<FONT color=3D"#0000A0"> My<BR>
first week, part time, will net me 3,700.00 dollars</FONT>
<FONT color=3D"#000000">  . Your<BR>
professionalism in both the manual and the video opened<BR>
doors for me in the future. There's no stopping me now.<BR>
Recently Thomas states he has over $8,500,000 worth of<BR>
judgments he is working on.<BR>
<BR>
After only having this course for four months, Larry S. in<BR>
area code 314 stated to us: " </FONT>
<FONT color=3D"#0000A0"> I am now making $2,000.00 per<BR>
week </FONT>
<FONT color=3D"#000000"> and expect this to grow to twice this amount with=
in the<BR>
next year. I am having a ball. I have over $250,000 in<BR>
judgments I am collecting on now."<BR>
<BR>
After having our course for 7 months Larry S. in 314 stated<BR>
" </FONT>
<FONT color=3D"#0000A0"> I am now making $12,000.00</FONT>
<FONT color=3D"#000000">  per month and have approximately<BR>
$500,000.00 in judgments I am collecting on. Looks like I<BR>
will have to hire someone to help out"<BR>
<BR>
Marshal in area code 407 states to us "I feel bad, you only<BR>
charged me $259.00 for this course and it is a goldmine. I<BR>
have added 3 full time people to help me after only having<BR>
your course for 5 months"<BR>
<BR>
>From the above information and actual results you can see<BR>
why we can state the following:<BR>
<BR>
With our course you can own your own successful business.<BR>
A business which earns you substantial income now and one<BR>
which could be sold in 3-5 years, paying you enough to<BR>
retire on and travel the world. A business which is<BR>
extremely interesting to be in. A Business in which every<BR>
day is new and exciting.<BR>
<BR>
None of your days will be hum-drum. Your brain is<BR>
Challenged. A business, which protects you from Corporate<BR>
Downsizing. A business which you can start part time from<BR>
your home and later, if you so desire, you can work in full<BR>
time. A business, which is your ticket to freedom from<BR>
others telling you what to do. A business, which lets you<BR>
control your own destiny. Our training has made this happen<BR>
for many others already. Make it happen for you!<BR>
<BR>
If the above sounds interesting to you then its time for you<BR>
to talk to a real live human being, no cost or obligation<BR>
on your part.<BR>

<p>
    JAMES is a multi-protocol message processing and storage engine. JAMES
    currently consists of:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> two mail prototcol servers (SMTP and POP3),</li>
  <li> a remote administration server,</li>
  <li> a mail processing engine that supports the Mailet API</li>
  <li> file-system message storage and a message storage interface to RDBMS's</li>
  <li> file-system user record storage and an experimental interface to LDAP directories</li>
  <li> beta support for TLS (SSL) for POP3 and remote administration</li>
</ul>
<p>
    JAMES is built on top of Avalon, the Java Apache Server Framework.
    Versions 1.1 and 1.2 of James use a slightly older version of Avalon,
    specifically the <i>avalon-james-1-1b1</i> branch. We intend to
    migrate to the new Avalon in the near future.

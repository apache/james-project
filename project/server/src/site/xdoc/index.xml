    <section name="What is it?">
      <p>The Apache Java Enterprise Mail Server (a.k.a. Apache James) is a 100% pure <b>Java SMTP and POP3 Mail server and NNTP News server</b>.  We have designed James to be a complete and portable enterprise mail engine solution based on currently available open protocols. </p>
      <p>James is also a <i>mail application platform</i>.  We have developed a Java API to let you write Java code to process emails that we call the mailet API.  A <b>mailet</b> can generate an automatic reply, update a database, prevent spam, build a message archive, or whatever you can imagine.  A <b>matcher</b> determines whether your mailet should process an email in the server.  The James project hosts the Mailet API, and James provides an implementation of this mail application platform API.</p>
      <p>James is based upon the Apache Avalon application framework, formerly a product of the Apache Avalon project (see "news" below).</p>
      <p>James requires Java 1.4 (For further information you may want to search the web, our <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/server-dev@james.apache.org/">dev</a> and <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/server-user@james.apache.org/">user</a> mail archives or our <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/james">wiki</a>).</p>

       A Summary of the X.500(96) User Schema for use with LDAPv3

1. Status of this Memo

   This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for the
   Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
   improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the "Internet
   Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the standardization state
   and status of this protocol.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

IESG Note

   This document describes a directory access protocol that provides
   both read and update access.  Update access requires secure
   authentication, but this document does not mandate implementation of
   any satisfactory authentication mechanisms.

   In accordance with RFC 2026, section 4.4.1, this specification is
   being approved by IESG as a Proposed Standard despite this
   limitation, for the following reasons:

   a. to encourage implementation and interoperability testing of
      these protocols (with or without update access) before they
      are deployed, and

   b. to encourage deployment and use of these protocols in read-only
      applications.  (e.g. applications where LDAPv3 is used as
      a query language for directories which are updated by some
      secure mechanism other than LDAP), and

   c. to avoid delaying the advancement and deployment of other Internet
      standards-track protocols which require the ability to query, but
      not update, LDAPv3 directory servers.

   Readers are hereby warned that until mandatory authentication
   mechanisms are standardized, clients and servers written according to
   this specification which make use of update functionality are
   UNLIKELY TO INTEROPERATE, or MAY INTEROPERATE ONLY IF AUTHENTICATION
   IS REDUCED TO AN UNACCEPTABLY WEAK LEVEL.

RFC 2256                     LDAPv3 Schema                 December 1997


   Implementors are hereby discouraged from deploying LDAPv3 clients or
   servers which implement the update functionality, until a Proposed
   Standard for mandatory authentication in LDAPv3 has been approved and
   published as an RFC.

2. Abstract

   This document provides an overview of the attribute types and object
   classes defined by the ISO and ITU-T committees in the X.500
   documents, in particular those intended for use by directory clients.
   This is the most widely used schema for LDAP/X.500 directories, and
   many other schema definitions for white pages objects use it as a
   basis.  This document does not cover attributes used for the
   administration of X.500 directory servers, nor does it include
   attributes defined by other ISO/ITU-T documents.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [6].

3. General Issues

   This document references syntaxes given in section 6 of this document
   and section 6 of [1].  Matching rules are listed in section 8 of this
   document and section 8 of [1].

   The attribute type and object class definitions are written using the
   BNF form of AttributeTypeDescription and ObjectClassDescription given
   in [1].  Lines have been folded for readability.

4. Source

   The schema definitions in this document are based on those found in
   X.500 [2],[3],[4],[5], and updates to these documents, specifically:

   Three new attributes supportedAlgorithms, deltaRevocationList and
   dmdName, and the objectClass dmd, are defined in the X.500(96)
   documents.

5. Attribute Types

   An LDAP server implementation SHOULD recognize the attribute types
   described in this section.

5.1. objectClass

   The values of the objectClass attribute describe the kind of object
   which an entry represents.  The objectClass attribute is present in
   every entry, with at least two values.  One of the values is either
   "top" or "alias".

    ( 2.5.4.0 NAME 'objectClass' EQUALITY objectIdentifierMatch
      SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.38 )

5.2. aliasedObjectName

   The aliasedObjectName attribute is used by the directory service if
   the entry containing this attribute is an alias.

    ( 2.5.4.1 NAME 'aliasedObjectName' EQUALITY distinguishedNameMatch
      SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.12 SINGLE-VALUE )

5.3. knowledgeInformation

   This attribute is no longer used.

5.4. cn

   This is the X.500 commonName attribute, which contains a name of an
   object.  If the object corresponds to a person, it is typically the
   person's full name.

    ( 2.5.4.3 NAME 'cn' SUP name )

   The name attribute type is the attribute supertype from which string
   attribute types typically used for naming may be formed.  It is
   unlikely that values of this type itself will occur in an entry. LDAP
   server implementations which do not support attribute subtyping need
   not recognize this attribute in requests.   Client implementations
   MUST NOT assume that LDAP servers are capable of performing attribute
   subtyping.

5.47. dnQualifier

   The dnQualifier attribute type specifies disambiguating information
   to add to the relative distinguished name of an entry.  It is
   intended for use when merging data from multiple sources in order to
   prevent conflicts between entries which would otherwise have the same
   name. It is recommended that the value of the dnQualifier attribute

6. Syntaxes

   Servers SHOULD recognize the syntaxes defined in this section.  Each
   syntax begins with a sample value of the ldapSyntaxes attribute which
   defines the OBJECT IDENTIFIER of the syntax.  The descriptions of
   syntax names are not carried in protocol, and are not guaranteed to
   be unique.

   ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.14 DESC 'Delivery Method' )

   Values in this syntax are encoded according to the following BNF:

      delivery-value = pdm / ( pdm whsp "$" whsp delivery-value )

      pdm = "any" / "mhs" / "physical" / "telex" / "teletex" /
                "g3fax" / "g4fax" / "ia5" / "videotex" / "telephone"

   Example:

      telephone

6.2. Enhanced Guide

   ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.21 DESC 'Enhanced Guide' )

   Values in this syntax are encoded according to the following BNF:

      EnhancedGuide = woid whsp "#" whsp criteria whsp "#" whsp subset

      subset = "baseobject" / "oneLevel" / "wholeSubtree"



Wahl                        Standards Track                    [Page 12]

RFC 2256                     LDAPv3 Schema                 December 1997


   The criteria production is defined in the Guide syntax below.  This
   syntax has been added subsequent to RFC 1778.

   Example:

      person#(sn)#oneLevel

6.3. Guide

   ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.25 DESC 'Guide' )

   Values in this syntax are encoded according to the following BNF:

      guide-value = [ object-class "#" ] criteria

      object-class = woid

      criteria = criteria-item / criteria-set / ( "!" criteria )

      criteria-set = ( [ "(" ] criteria "&" criteria-set [ ")" ] ) /
                     ( [ "(" ] criteria "|" criteria-set [ ")" ] )

      criteria-item = [ "(" ] attributetype "$" match-type [ ")" ]

      match-type = "EQ" / "SUBSTR" / "GE" / "LE" / "APPROX"

   This syntax should not be used for defining new attributes.

6.4. Octet String

   ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.40 DESC 'Octet String' )

   Values in this syntax are encoded as octet strings.


   Example:

      secret

6.5. Teletex Terminal Identifier

   ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.51 DESC 'Teletex Terminal Identifier' )

   Values in this syntax are encoded according to the following BNF:

      teletex-id = ttx-term  0*("$" ttx-param)

      ttx-term   = printablestring



Wahl                        Standards Track                    [Page 13]

RFC 2256                     LDAPv3 Schema                 December 1997


      ttx-param  = ttx-key ":" ttx-value

      ttx-key    = "graphic" / "control" / "misc" / "page" / "private"

      ttx-value  = octetstring

   In the above, the first printablestring is the encoding of the first
   portion of the teletex terminal identifier to be encoded, and the
   subsequent 0 or more octetstrings are subsequent portions of the
   teletex terminal identifier.

6.6. Telex Number

   ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.52 DESC 'Telex Number' )

   Values in this syntax are encoded according to the following BNF:

      telex-number  = actual-number "$" country "$" answerback

      actual-number = printablestring

      country       = printablestring

      answerback    = printablestring

   In the above, actual-number is the syntactic representation of the
   number portion of the TELEX number being encoded, country is the
   TELEX country code, and answerback is the answerback code of a TELEX
   terminal.

6.7. Supported Algorithm

   ( 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.49 DESC 'Supported Algorithm' )

   No printable representation of values of the supportedAlgorithms
   attribute is defined in this document.  Clients which wish to store
   and retrieve this attribute MUST use "supportedAlgorithms;binary", in
   which the value is transferred as a binary encoding.

7. Object Classes

   LDAP servers MUST recognize the object classes "top" and "subschema".
   LDAP servers SHOULD recognize all the other object classes listed
   here as values of the objectClass attribute.

8. Matching Rules

   Servers MAY implement additional matching rules.

8.1. octetStringMatch

   Servers which implement the extensibleMatch filter SHOULD allow the
   matching rule listed in this section to be used in the
   extensibleMatch.  In general these servers SHOULD allow matching
   rules to be used with all attribute types known to the server, when
   the assertion syntax of the matching rule is the same as the value
   syntax of the attribute.

   ( 2.5.13.17 NAME 'octetStringMatch'
    SYNTAX 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.40 )

9. Security Considerations

   Attributes of directory entries are used to provide descriptive
   information about the real-world objects they represent, which can be
   people, organizations or devices.  Most countries have privacy laws
   regarding the publication of information about people.

   Transfer of cleartext passwords are strongly discouraged where the
   underlying transport service cannot guarantee confidentiality and may
   result in disclosure of the password to unauthorized parties.

10. Acknowledgements

   The definitions on which this document have been developed by
   committees for telecommunications and international standards.  No
   new attribute definitions have been added.  The syntax definitions
   are based on the ISODE "QUIPU" implementation of X.500.

= Guice-Memory Module How-to

== Requirements

 * Java SDK, the minimum version can be found in the https://github.com/apache/james-project/blob/master/pom.xml#L612[build descriptor]

== Running

To run james, you have to create a directory containing required configuration files.

James requires the configuration to be in a subfolder of working directory that is called
**conf**. A https://github.com/apache/james-project/tree/master/server/apps/migration/migration-core-data-jpa-to-pg/sample-configuration[sample directory]
is provided with some default values you may need to replace. You will need to update its content to match your needs.

Once everything is set up, you just have to run the jar with:

[source]
----
$ java -Dworking.directory=. -Dlogback.configurationFile=conf/logback.xml -Djdk.tls.ephemeralDHKeySize=2048 -jar migration-core-data-jpa-to-pg.jar

=== AtMost

Checks that a mail did at most X executions on a specific operation.

 If no executions have been performed previously for Y attribute, it will be set up.
 In the mail, every time the check succeeds, its counter will be incremented by one.
The check fails when the defined X limit is reached.

* X - count of how many times a specific operation is performed
* Y - name of attribute represented for specific operation executions, default value is: *AT_MOST_EXECUTIONS*


The example below will match a mail with at most 3 executions on the mailet
with attribute name *AT_MOST_EXECUTIONS*

....
<mailet match="AtMost=AT_MOST_EXECUTIONS:3" class="<any-class>">
</mailet>
....

=== IsSenderInRRTLoop

This matcher allow you to know if the sender of an email is part of a RRT loop.

This is useful when bouncing upon RRT execution issues: we don't want to create a bouncing loop
(as the execution of that RRT loop will fail).

Example:

....
<mailet match="IsSenderInRRTLoop" class="<any-class>"/>
....

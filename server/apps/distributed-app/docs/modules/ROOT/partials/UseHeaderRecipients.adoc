=== UseHeaderRecipients

Mailet designed to process the recipients from the mail headers rather
than the recipients specified in the SMTP message header.  This can be
useful if your mail is redirected on-route by a mail server that
substitutes a fixed recipient address for the original.


To use this, match against the redirection address using the
*RecipientIs* matcher and set the mailet 'class' to
*UseHeaderRecipients*.  This will cause the email to be
re-injected into the root process with the recipient substituted
by all the recipients in the Mail-For, To and Cc headers
of the message.

e.g.

....
<mailet match="RecipientIs=forwarded@myhost" class="UseHeaderRecipients">
</mailet>
....

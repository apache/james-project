=== Manage Sieve scripts via a mailet

Each user can manage his SIEVE scripts through the `ManageSieveMailet` mailet.

To use the manage SIEVE mailet :

* You need to create the user sievemanager@DOMAIN ( if you don't, the SMTP server will check the domain, recognize it, and look for an absent local user, and will generate an error ).
* You can send Manage Sieve commands by mail to sievemanager@DOMAIN. Your subject must contain the command. Scripts need to be added as attachments and need the ".sieve" extension.

To activate a script for a user, you need the following combination :

* PUTSCRIPT scriptname
* SETACTIVE scriptname

=== FetchedFrom

Matches mail with a header set by Fetchpop X-fetched-from

fetchpop sets X-fetched-by to the "name" of the fetchpop fetch task.

This is used to match all mail fetched from a specific pop account.

Once the condition is met the header is stripped from the message to prevent looping if
the mail is re-inserted into the spool.

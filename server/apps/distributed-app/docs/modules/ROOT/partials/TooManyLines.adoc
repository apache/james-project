=== TooManyLines

This matcher matches emails that have too many lines. This allows better rejection of emails when, for instance, MIME4J
is configured with a limited number of lines.

<p>The example below will match mail with more than 10000 lines</p>

<mailet match="TooManyLines=10000" class="<any-class>"/>

=== RecipientRewriteTable

Mailet which should get used when using RecipientRewriteTable-Store to
implementations for mappings of forwards and aliases.

By specifying an 'errorProcessor' you can specify your logic upon RecipientRewriteTable failures.

Example:

....
 <mailet match="All" class="RecipientRewriteTable">
   <errorProcessor>rrt-errors</errorProcessor>
 </mailet>
....

The *rewriteSenderUponForward* option (default to true) can be used to prevent senders to be rewritten upon forwards in the transport envelope
(JAMES 3.8.0 default behaviour). *WARNING*: Please note that not rewriting the sender will cause issues forwarding emails
from external senders to external addresses as the DKIM and SPF records will not be matching the ones of the sending
domain.

The *forwardAutoSubmittedEmails* option (default to false) can be used to prevent forwarding bounces as such a scenario
can lead to an infinite loop if the forward recipient bounces the email.

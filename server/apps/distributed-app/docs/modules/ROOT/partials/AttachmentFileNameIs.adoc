=== AttachmentFileNameIs

Checks if at least one attachment has a file name which matches any
element of a comma-separated or space-separated list of file name masks.

Syntax: *match="AttachmentFileNameIs=[-d] [-z] masks"*

The match is case insensitive.

File name masks may start with a wildcard '\*'.

Multiple file name masks can be specified, e.g.: '\*.scr,\*.bat'.

If '*-d*' is coded, some debug info will be logged.

If '*-z*' is coded, the check will be non-recursively applied
to the contents of any attached '*.zip' file.

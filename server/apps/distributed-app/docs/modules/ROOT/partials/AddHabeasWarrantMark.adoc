=== AddHabeasWarrantMark

This matcher adds the Hebeas Warrant Mark to a message.

For details see: http://www.hebeas.com</p>

Usage:

....
<mailet match="All" class="AddHabeasWarrantMark" />;
....

NOTE: Although this mailet is covered by the Apache Software License,
the Habeas Warrant Mark is copyright.  A separate license from Habeas
is required in order to legally attach the Habeas Warrant Mark to
e-mail messages.  Each James Administrator is responsible for
ensuring that James is configured to attach the Habeas Warrant Mark
only to e-mail covered by a suitable license received from Habeas.

Because the Habeas Warrant Mark is copyright material, I have asked
for and received the following explicit statement from Habeas:

You do not yourself need the authorization to build the functionality
into the [mailet];  what one needs authorization, in the form of a
license, for, is to use the mark *in headers*, in outgoing email.
However, please let me know if you would like something more
formal, and I can try to have something faxed to you.

That's absolutely perfect!

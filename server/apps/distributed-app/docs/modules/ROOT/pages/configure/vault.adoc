Deleted Messages Vault is the component in charge of retaining messages before they are going to be deleted.
Messages stored in the Deleted Messages Vault could be deleted after exceeding their retentionPeriod (explained below).
It also supports to restore or export messages matching with defined criteria in
xref:operate/webadmin.adoc#_deleted_messages_vault[WebAdmin deleted messages vault document] by using
xref:operate/webadmin.adoc#_deleted_messages_vault[WebAdmin endpoints].

== Deleted Messages Vault Configuration

Once the vault is active, James will start moving deleted messages to it asynchronously.

The Deleted Messages Vault also stores and manages deleted messages into a BlobStore. The BlobStore can be either
based on an object storage or on Cassandra. For configuring the BlobStore the vault will use, you can look at
xref:configure/blobstore.adoc[*blobstore.properties*] BlobStore Configuration section.

= Distributed James Server &mdash; jvm.properties
:navtitle: jvm.properties

This file may contain any additional system properties for tweaking JVM execution. When you normally would add a command line option `-Dmy.property=whatever`, you can put it in this file as `my.property=whatever` instead. These properties will be added as system properties on server start.

Note that in some rare cases this might not work,
when a property affects very early JVM start behaviour.

For testing purposes, you may specify a different file path via the command line option `-Dextra.props=/some/other/jvm.properties`.

== Control the threshold memory
This governs the threshold MimeMessageInputStreamSource relies on for storing MimeMessage content on disk.

In `jvm.properties`
----
james.message.memory.threshold=12K
----

(Optional). String (size, integer + size units, example: `12 KIB`, supported units are bytes KIB MIB GIB TIB). Defaults to 100KIB.

== Enable the copy of message in memory
Should MimeMessageWrapper use a copy of the message in memory? Or should bigger message exceeding james.message.memory.threshold
be copied to temporary files?

----
james.message.usememorycopy=true
----

Optional. Boolean. Defaults to false. Recommended value is false.

== Running resource leak detection
It is used to detect a resource not be disposed of before it's garbage-collected.

In `jvm.properties`
----
james.lifecycle.leak.detection.mode=advanced
----

Allowed mode values are: none, simple, advanced, testing

The purpose of each mode is introduced in `config-system.xml`

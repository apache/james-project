This files allow to define the amount of data that should be fetched 'at once' when interacting with the mailbox. This is
needed as IMAP can generate some potentially large requests.

Increasing these values tend to fasten individual requests, at the cost of enabling potential higher load.

Consult this link:https://github.com/apache/james-project/blob/master/server/apps/distributed-app/sample-configuration/batchsizes.properties[example]
to get some examples and hints.

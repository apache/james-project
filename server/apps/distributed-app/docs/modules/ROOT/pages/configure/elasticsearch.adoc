Consult this link:https://github.com/apache/james-project/blob/master/server/apps/distributed-app/sample-configuration/cassandra.properties[example]
to get some examples and hints.

If you want more explanation about ElasticSearch configuration, you should visit the dedicated https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/index.html[documentation].

== ElasticSearch Configuration

This file section is used to configure the connection tp an ElasticSearch cluster.

Here are the properties allowing to do so :

.elasticsearch.properties content
|===
| Property name | explanation

| elasticsearch.clusterName
| Is the name of the cluster used by James.

| elasticsearch.nb.shards
| Number of shards for index provisionned by James

| elasticsearch.nb.replica
| Number of replica for index provisionned by James (default: 0)

| elasticsearch.index.waitForActiveShards
| Wait for a certain number of active shard copies before proceeding with the operation. Defaults to 1.
You may consult the https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.10/docs-index_.html#active-shards[documentation] for more information.

| elasticsearch.retryConnection.maxRetries
| Number of retries when connecting the cluster

| elasticsearch.retryConnection.minDelay
| Minimum delay between connection attempts
|===

=== Mailbox search

The main use of ElasticSearch within the Distributed Server is indexing the mailbox content of users in order to enable
powerful and efficient full-text search of the mailbox content.

Data indexing is performed asynchronously in a reliable fashion via a MailboxListener.

Here are the properties related to the use of ElasticSearch for Mailbox Search:

.elasticsearch.properties content
|===
| Property name | explanation

| elasticsearch.index.mailbox.name
| Name of the mailbox index backed by the alias. It will be created if missing.

| elasticsearch.index.name
| *Deprecated* Use *elasticsearch.index.mailbox.name* instead.
Name of the mailbox index backed by the alias. It will be created if missing.

| elasticsearch.alias.read.mailbox.name
| Name of the alias to use by Apache James for mailbox reads. It will be created if missing.
The target of the alias is the index name configured above.

| elasticsearch.alias.read.name
| *Deprecated* Use *elasticsearch.alias.read.mailbox.name* instead.
Name of the alias to use by Apache James for mailbox reads. It will be created if missing.
The target of the alias is the index name configured above.

| elasticsearch.alias.write.mailbox.name
| Name of the alias to use by Apache James for mailbox writes. It will be created if missing.
The target of the alias is the index name configured above.

| elasticsearch.alias.write.name
| *Deprecated* Use *elasticsearch.alias.write.mailbox.name* instead.
Name of the alias to use by Apache James for mailbox writes. It will be created if missing.
The target of the alias is the index name configured above.

| elasticsearch.indexAttachments
| Indicates if you wish to index attachments or not (default: true).
|===

=== Quota search

Users are indexed by quota usage, allowing operators a quick audit of users quota occupation.

Users quota are asynchronously indexed upon quota changes via a dedicated MailboxListener.

The following properties affect quota search :

.elasticsearch.properties content
|===
| Property name | explanation

| elasticsearch.index.quota.ratio.name
| Specify the ElasticSearch alias name used for quotas

| elasticsearch.alias.read.quota.ratio.name
| Specify the ElasticSearch alias name used for reading quotas

| elasticsearch.alias.write.quota.ratio.name
| Specify the ElasticSearch alias name used for writing quotas
|===

=== Disabling ElasticSearch

ElasticSearch component can be disabled but consider it would make search feature to not work. In particular it will break JMAP protocol and SEARCH IMAP comment in an nondeterministic way.
This is controlled in the `search.properties` file via the `implementation` property (defaults
to `ElasticSearch`). Setting this configuration parameter to `scanning` will effectively disable ElasticSearch, no
further indexation will be done however searches will rely on the scrolling search, leading to expensive and longer
searches. Disabling ElasticSearch requires no extra action, however
xref:operate/webadmin.adoc#reindexing_all_mails[a full re-indexing]needs to be carried out when enabling ElasticSearch.

== Exporting metrics directly to ElasticSearch

WARNING: A separate ElasticSearch server is required, as an ElasticSearch 6.3 is needed, which is
not compatible with ElasticSearch 7.10, required by James.

For configuring the metric reporting on ElasticSearch :

.elasticsearch.properties content
|===
| Property name | explanation

| elasticsearch.http.host
| Optional. Host to report metrics on. Defaults to master host. Must be specified if metric export to ElasticSearch is enabled.

| elasticsearch.http.port
| Optional. Http port to use for publishing metrics. Must be specified if metric export to ElasticSearch is enabled.

| elasticsearch.metrics.reports.enabled
| Optional. Boolean value. Enables metrics reporting. Defaults to false.

| elasticsearch.metrics.reports.period
| Optional. Seconds between metric reports. Defaults to 60 seconds.

| elasticsearch.metrics.reports.index
| Optional. Index to publish metrics on. Defaults to `james-metrics`.

|===

== SSL Trusting Configuration

By default, James will use the system TrustStore to validate https server certificates, if the certificate on
ES side is already in the system TrustStore, you can leave the sslValidationStrategy property empty or set it to default.

.elasticsearch.properties content
|===
| Property name | explanation

| elasticsearch.hostScheme.https.sslValidationStrategy
| Optional. Accept only *default*, *ignore*, *override*. Default is *default*. default: Use the default SSL TrustStore of the system.
ignore: Ignore SSL Validation check (not recommended).
override: Override the SSL Context to use a custom TrustStore containing ES server's certificate.

|===

In some cases, you want to secure the connection from clients to ES by setting up a *https* protocol
with a self signed certificate. And you prefer to left the system ca-certificates un touch.
There are possible solutions to let the ES RestHighLevelClient to trust your self signed certificate.

Second solution: importing a TrustStore containing the certificate into SSL context.
A certificate normally contains two parts: a public part in .crt file, another private part in .key file.
To trust the server, the client needs to be acknowledged that the server's certificate is in the list of
client's TrustStore. Basically, you can create a local TrustStore file containing the public part of a remote server
by execute this command:

....
keytool -import -v -trustcacerts -file certificatePublicFile.crt -keystore trustStoreFileName.jks -keypass fillThePassword -storepass fillThePassword
....

When there is a TrustStore file and the password to read, fill two options *trustStorePath*
and *trustStorePassword* with the TrustStore location and the password. ES client will accept
the certificate of ES service.

.elasticsearch.properties content
|===
| Property name | explanation

| elasticsearch.hostScheme.https.trustStorePath
| Optional. Use it when https is configured in elasticsearch.hostScheme, and sslValidationStrategy is *override*
Configure Elasticsearch rest client to use this trustStore file to recognize nginx's ssl certificate.
Once you chose *override*, you need to specify both trustStorePath and trustStorePassword.

| elasticsearch.hostScheme.https.trustStorePassword
| Optional. Use it when https is configured in elasticsearch.hostScheme, and sslValidationStrategy is *override*
Configure Elasticsearch rest client to use this trustStore file with the specified password.
Once you chose *override*, you need to specify both trustStorePath and trustStorePassword.

|===

During SSL handshaking, the client can determine whether accept or reject connecting to a remote server by its hostname.
You can configure to use which HostNameVerifier in the client.

.elasticsearch.properties content
|===
| Property name | explanation

| elasticsearch.hostScheme.https.hostNameVerifier
| Optional. Default is *default*. default: using the default hostname verifier provided by apache http client.
accept_any_hostname: accept any host (not recommended).

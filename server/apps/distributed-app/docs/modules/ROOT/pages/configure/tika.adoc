= Distributed James Server &mdash; tika.properties
:navtitle: tika.properties

When using ElasticSearch, you can configure an external Tika server for extracting and indexing text from attachments.
Thus you can significantly improve user experience upon text searches.

Note: You can launch a tika server using this command line:

....
docker run --name tika linagora/docker-tikaserver:1.24
....

Here are the different properties:

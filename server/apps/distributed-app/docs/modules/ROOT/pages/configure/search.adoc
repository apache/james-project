| Property name | explanation

| implementation
| The implementation to be used for search. Should be one of:
 - *opensearch* : Index and search mails into OpenSearch.
 - *scanning* : Do not index documents and perform scanning search, scrolling mailbox for matching contents.
 This implementation can have a prohibitive cost.
 - *opensearch-disabled* : Saves events to index into event dead letter. Make searches fails.
 This is useful to start James without OpenSearch while still tracking messages to index for later recovery. This
 can be used in order to ease delays for disaster recovery action plans.

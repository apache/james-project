= Distributed James Server &mdash; Anti-Spam configuration
:navtitle: Anti-Spam configuration

Anti-Spam system can be configured via two main different mechanisms:

* SMTP Hooks;
* Mailets;

== AntiSpam SMTP Hooks

"FastFail" SMTP Hooks acts to reject before spooling
on the SMTP level. SpamAssasin hook can be used as a fastfail hook, therefore
SpamAssassin must run as a server on the same machine as the Apache James Server.

SMTP Hooks for non-existent users, DSN filter, domains with invalid MX record,
can also be configured.

*SpamAssassinHandler* (experimental) also enables to classify the messages as spam or not
with an configurable score threshold (`0.0`, non configurable). Only a global database is supported. Per user spam
detection is not supported by this hook.

== AntiSpam Mailets

* *SpamAssassin* Mailet is designed to classify the messages as spam or not
with an configurable score threshold. Usually a message will only be
considered as spam if it matches multiple criteria; matching just a single test
will not usually be enough to reach the threshold. Note that this mailet is executed on a per-user basis.

Here is an example of mailet pipeline conducting out SpamAssassin execution:

....
<mailet match="All" class="SpamAssassin">
    <onMailetException>ignore</onMailetException>
    <spamdHost>spamassassin</spamdHost>
    <spamdPort>783</spamdPort>
</mailet>
<mailet match="All" class="MailAttributesToMimeHeaders">
    <!-- This mailet is not required, but useful to have SpamAssassin score in headers-->
    <simplemapping>org.apache.james.spamassassin.status; X-JAMES-SPAMASSASSIN-STATUS</simplemapping>
    <simplemapping>org.apache.james.spamassassin.flag; X-JAMES-SPAMASSASSIN-FLAG</simplemapping>
</mailet>
<mailet match="IsMarkedAsSpam" class="WithStorageDirective">
    <targetFolderName>Spam</targetFolderName>
</mailet>
....

* *BayesianAnalysis* (unsupported) in the Mailet uses Bayesian probability to classify mail as
spam or not spam. It relies on the training data coming from the usersâ€™ judgment.
Users need to manually judge as spam and send to spam@thisdomain.com, oppositely,
if not spam they then send to not.spam@thisdomain.com. BayesianAnalysisfeeder learns
from this training dataset, and build predictive models based on Bayesian probability.
There will be a certain table for maintaining the frequency of Corpus for keywords
in the database. Every 10 mins a thread in the BayesianAnalysis will check and update
the table. Also, the correct approach is to send the original spam or non-spam
as an attachment to another message sent to the feeder in order to avoid bias from the
current sender's email header.

== Feedback for SpamAssassin

If enabled, the `SpamAssassinListener` will asynchronously report users mails moved to the `Spam` mailbox as Spam,
and other mails as `Ham`, effectively populating the user database for per user spam detection. This enables a per-user
Spam categorization to be conducted out by the SpamAssassin mailet, the SpamAssassin hook being unaffected.

The SpamAssassin listener requires an extra configuration file `spamassassin.properties` to configure SpamAssassin connection (optional):

.spamassassin.properties content
|===
| Property name | explanation

| spamassassin.host
| Hostname of the SpamAssassin server. Defaults to 127.0.0.1.

| spamassassin.port
| Port of the SpamAssassin server. Defaults to 783.
|===

Note that this configuration file only affects the listener, and not the hook or mailet.

The SpamAssassin listener needs to explicitly be registered with xref:configure/listeners.adoc[listeners.xml].

Example:

....
<listeners>
  <listener>
    <class>org.apache.james.mailbox.spamassassin.SpamAssassinListener</class>
    <async>true</async>
  </listener>
</listeners>
....

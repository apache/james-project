= Distributed James Server &mdash; Anti-Spam configuration
:navtitle: Anti-Spam configuration

Anti-Spam system can be configured via two main different mechanisms:

* SMTP Hooks;
* Mailets;

== AntiSpam SMTP Hooks

"FastFail" SMTP Hooks acts to reject before spooling
on the SMTP level. The Spam detector hook can be used as a fastfail hook, therefore
Spam filtering system must run as a server on the same machine as the Apache James Server.

SMTP Hooks for non-existent users, DSN filter, domains with invalid MX record,
can also be configured.

*SpamAssassinHandler* (experimental) also enables to classify the messages as spam or not
with a configurable score threshold (`0.0`, non-configurable). Only a global database is supported. Per user spam
detection is not supported by this hook.

== AntiSpam Mailets

James' repository provide two AntiSpam mailets: SpamAssassin and RspamdScanner.
We can select one in them for filtering spam mail.

* *SpamAssassin and RspamdScanner* Mailet is designed to classify the messages as spam or not
with a configurable score threshold. Usually a message will only be
considered as spam if it matches multiple criteria; matching just a single test
will not usually be enough to reach the threshold. Note that this mailet is executed on a per-user basis.

=== Rspamd

The Rspamd extension (optional) requires an extra configuration file `rspamd.properties` to configure RSpamd connection

.rspamd.properties content
|===
| Property name | explanation

| rSpamdUrl
| URL defining the Rspamd's server. Eg: http://rspamd:11334

| rSpamdPassword
| Password for pass authentication when request to Rspamd's server. Eg: admin

| rspamdTimeout
| Integer. Timeout for http requests to Rspamd. Default to 15 seconds.

| perUserBayes
| Boolean. Whether to scan/learn mails using per-user Bayes. Default to false.
|===

`RspamdScanner` supports the following options:

* You can specify the `virusProcessor` if you want to enable virus scanning for mail. Upon configurable `virusProcessor`
you can specify how James process mail virus. We provide a sample Rspamd mailet and `virusProcessor` configuration:

* You can specify the `rejectSpamProcessor`. Emails marked as `rejected` by Rspamd will be redirected to this
processor. This corresponds to emails with the highest spam score, thus delivering them to users as marked as spam
might not even be desirable.

* The `rewriteSubject` option allows to rewritte subjects when asked by Rspamd.

This mailet can scan mails against per-user Bayes by configure `perUserBayes` in `rspamd.properties`. This is achieved
through the use of Rspamd `Deliver-To` HTTP header. If true, Rspamd will be called for each recipient of the mail, which comes at a performance cost. If true, subjects are not rewritten.
If true `virusProcessor` and `rejectSpamProcessor` are honnered per user, at the cost of email copies. Default to false.

Here is an example of mailet pipeline conducting out RspamdScanner execution:

....
<processor state="local-delivery" enableJmx="true">
    <mailet match="All" class="org.apache.james.rspamd.RspamdScanner">
        <rewriteSubject>true</rewriteSubject>
        <virusProcessor>virus</virusProcessor>
        <rejectSpamProcessor>spam</rejectSpamProcessor>
    </mailet>
    <mailet match="IsMarkedAsSpam=org.apache.james.rspamd.status" class="WithStorageDirective">
        <targetFolderName>Spam</targetFolderName>
    </mailet>
    <mailet match="All" class="LocalDelivery"/>
</processor>
<!--Choose one between these two following virus processor, or configure a custom one if you want-->
<!--Hard reject virus mail-->
<processor state="virus" enableJmx="false">
    <mailet match="All" class="ToRepository">
        <repositoryPath>file://var/mail/virus/</repositoryPath>
    </mailet>
</processor>
<!--Soft reject virus mail-->
<processor state="virus" enableJmx="false">
    <mailet match="All" class="StripAttachment">
        <remove>all</remove>
        <pattern>.*</pattern>
    </mailet>
    <mailet match="All" class="AddSubjectPrefix">
        <subjectPrefix>[VIRUS]</subjectPrefix>
    </mailet>
    <mailet match="All" class="LocalDelivery"/>
</processor>
<!--Store rejected spam emails (with a very high score) -->
<processor state="virus" enableJmx="false">
    <mailet match="All" class="ToRepository">
        <repositoryPath>cassandra://var/mail/spam</repositoryPath>
    </mailet>
</processor>
....

==== Feedback for Rspamd
If enabled, the `RspamdListener` will base on the Mailbox event to detect the message is a spam or not, then James will send report `spam` or `ham` to Rspamd.
This listener can report mails to per-user Bayes by configure `perUserBayes` in `rspamd.properties`.
The Rspamd listener needs to explicitly be registered with xref:configure/listeners.adoc[listeners.xml].

Example:

....
<listeners>
    <listener>
        <class>org.apache.james.rspamd.RspamdListener</class>
    </listener>
</listeners>
....

Alternatively, batch reports can be triggered on user mailbox content via webAdmin. link:https://github.com/apache/james-project/tree/master/third-party/rspamd#additional-webadmin-endpoints[Read more].


=== SpamAssassin
Here is an example of mailet pipeline conducting out SpamAssassin execution:

....
<mailet match="All" class="SpamAssassin">
    <onMailetException>ignore</onMailetException>
    <spamdHost>spamassassin</spamdHost>
    <spamdPort>783</spamdPort>
</mailet>
<mailet match="All" class="MailAttributesToMimeHeaders">
    <!-- This mailet is not required, but useful to have SpamAssassin score in headers-->
    <simplemapping>org.apache.james.spamassassin.status; X-JAMES-SPAMASSASSIN-STATUS</simplemapping>
    <simplemapping>org.apache.james.spamassassin.flag; X-JAMES-SPAMASSASSIN-FLAG</simplemapping>
</mailet>
<mailet match="IsMarkedAsSpam" class="WithStorageDirective">
    <targetFolderName>Spam</targetFolderName>
</mailet>
....

* *BayesianAnalysis* (unsupported) in the Mailet uses Bayesian probability to classify mail as
spam or not spam. It relies on the training data coming from the usersâ€™ judgment.
Users need to manually judge as spam and send to spam@thisdomain.com, oppositely,
if not spam they then send to not.spam@thisdomain.com. BayesianAnalysisfeeder learns
from this training dataset, and build predictive models based on Bayesian probability.
There will be a certain table for maintaining the frequency of Corpus for keywords
in the database. Every 10 mins a thread in the BayesianAnalysis will check and update
the table. Also, the correct approach is to send the original spam or non-spam
as an attachment to another message sent to the feeder in order to avoid bias from the
current sender's email header.

==== Feedback for SpamAssassin

If enabled, the `SpamAssassinListener` will asynchronously report users mails moved to the `Spam` mailbox as Spam,
and other mails as `Ham`, effectively populating the user database for per user spam detection. This enables a per-user
Spam categorization to be conducted out by the SpamAssassin mailet, the SpamAssassin hook being unaffected.

The SpamAssassin listener requires an extra configuration file `spamassassin.properties` to configure SpamAssassin connection (optional):

.spamassassin.properties content
|===
| Property name | explanation

| spamassassin.host
| Hostname of the SpamAssassin server. Defaults to 127.0.0.1.

| spamassassin.port
| Port of the SpamAssassin server. Defaults to 783.
|===

Note that this configuration file only affects the listener, and not the hook or mailet.

The SpamAssassin listener needs to explicitly be registered with xref:configure/listeners.adoc[listeners.xml].

Example:

....
<listeners>
  <listener>
    <class>org.apache.james.mailbox.spamassassin.SpamAssassinListener</class>
    <async>true</async>
  </listener>
</listeners>
....

= Distributed James Server &mdash; Configuration
:navtitle: Configuration

This section presents how to configure the Distributed server.

The Distributed Server relies on separated files for configuring various components. Some files follow a *xml* format
and some others follow a *property* format. Some files can be omitted, in which case the functionality can be disabled,
or rely on reasonable defaults.

The following configuration files are exposed:

== For protocols

By omitting these files, the underlying protocols will be disabled.

== System properties

Some tuning can be done via system properties. This includes:

.System properties
|===
| Property name | explanation

| james.message.memory.threshold
| (Optional). String (size, integer + size units, example: `12 KIB`, supported units are bytes KIB MIB GIB TIB). Defaults to 100KIB.
This governs the threshold MimeMessageInputStreamSource relies on for storing MimeMessage content on disk.
Below, data is stored in memory. Above data is stored on disk.
Lower values will lead to longer processing time but will minimize heap memory usage. Modern SSD hardware
should however support a high throughput. Higher values will lead to faster single mail processing at the cost
of higher heap usage.


| james.message.usememorycopy
|Optional. Boolean. Defaults to false. Recommended value is false.
Should MimeMessageWrapper use a copy of the message in memory? Or should bigger message exceeding james.message.memory.threshold 
be copied to temporary files?

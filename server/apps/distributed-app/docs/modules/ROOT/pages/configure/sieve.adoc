:navtitle: Sieve

James servers are able to evaluate and execute Sieve scripts.

Sieve is an extensible mail filtering language. It's limited
expressiveness (no loops or variables, no tests with side
effects) allows user created scripts to be run safely on email
servers. Sieve is targeted at the final delivery phase (where
an incoming email is transferred to a user's mailbox).

The following Sieve capabilities are supported by Apache James:

  - link:https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2234.txt[RFC 2234 ABNF]
  - link:https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2244.txt[RFC 2244 ACAP]
  - link:https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2298.txt[RFC 2298 MDN]
  - link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5228[RFC 5228 Sieve]
  - link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4790[RFC 4790 IAPCR]
  - link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5173[RFC 5173 Body Extension]
  - link:https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5230[RFC 5230 Vacations]

To be correctly executed, please note that the *Sieve* mailet is required to be positionned prior the
*LocalDelivery* mailet.

== Managing Sieve scripts

A user willing to manage his Sieve scripts on the server can do so via several means:

He can ask an admin to upload his script via the xref:operate/cli.adoc[CLI]

As James supports ManageSieve (link:https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5804[RFC-5804]) a user
can thus use compatible software to manage his Sieve scripts.</p>

== ManageSieve protocol

*WARNING*: ManageSieve protocol should be considered experimental.

Consult link:https://github.com/apache/james-project/blob/master/server/apps/distributed-app/sample-configuration/managesieveserver.xml[managesieveserver.xml]
in GIT to get some examples and hints.

The  service is controlled by a configuration block in the managesieveserver.xml.
The managesieveserver tag defines the boundaries of the configuration block.  It encloses
all the relevant configuration for the ManageSieve server.  The behavior of the ManageSieve service is
controlled by the attributes and children of this tag.

This tag has an optional boolean attribute - *enabled* - that defines whether the service is active or not.
The value defaults to "false" if
not present.

The standard children of the managesieveserver tag are:

.managesieveserver.xml content
|===
| Property name | explanation

| bind
| Configure this to bind to a specific inetaddress. This is an optional integer value.  This value is the port on which this ManageSieve server is configured to listen. If the tag or value is absent then the service
will bind to all network interfaces for the machine If the tag or value is omitted, the value will default to the standard ManageSieve port (port 4190 is the well-known/IANA registered port for ManageSieve.)

| tls
| Set to true to support STARTTLS or SSL for the Socket.
To use this you need to copy sunjce_provider.jar to /path/james/lib directory. To create a new keystore execute:
`keytool -genkey -alias james -keyalg RSA -storetype PKCS12 -keystore /path/to/james/conf/keystore`.
Please note that each IMAP server exposed on different port can specify its own keystore, independently from any other
TLS based protocols.

| connectionBacklog
| Number of connection backlog of the server (maximum number of queued connection requests)

| connectiontimeout
| Connection timeout in seconds

| connectionLimit
| Set the maximum simultaneous incoming connections for this service

| connectionLimitPerIP
| Set the maximum simultaneous incoming connections per IP for this service

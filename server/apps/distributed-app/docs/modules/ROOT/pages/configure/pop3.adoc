= Distributed James Server &mdash; pop3server.xml
:navtitle: pop3server.xml

Consult this link:https://github.com/apache/james-project/blob/master/server/apps/distributed-app/sample-configuration/pop3server.xml[example]
to get some examples and hints.

The POP3 service is controlled by a configuration block in the pop3server.xml.
The pop3server tag defines the boundaries of the configuration block.  It encloses
all the relevant configuration for the POP3 server.  The behavior of the POP service is
controlled by the attributes and children of this tag.

This tag has an optional boolean attribute - *enabled* - that defines whether the service is active or not.
The value defaults to "true" if not present.

The standard children of the pop3server tag are:

.jmx.properties content
|===
| Property name | explanation

| bind
| Configure this to bind to a specific inetaddress. This is an optional integer value.
This value is the port on which this POP3 server is configured
to listen. If the tag or value is absent then the service
will bind to all network interfaces for the machine If the tag or value is omitted,
the value will default to the standard POP3 port, 11
port 995 is the well-known/IANA registered port for POP3S  ie over SSL/TLS
port 110 is the well-known/IANA registered port for Standard POP3

| connectionBacklog
|

| tls
| Set to true to support STARTTLS or SSL for the Socket.
To create a new keystore execute:
`keytool -genkey -alias james -keyalg RSA -storetype PKCS12 -keystore /path/to/james/conf/keystore`
Please note that each POP3 server exposed on different port can specify its own keystore, independently from any other
TLS based protocols. Read xref:configure/ssl.adoc[SSL configuration page] for more information.

| handler.helloName
| This is the name used by the server to identify itself in the POP3
protocol.  If autodetect is TRUE, the server will discover its
own host name and use that in the protocol.  If discovery fails,
the value of 'localhost' is used.  If autodetect is FALSE, James
will use the specified value.

| handler.connectiontimeout
| Connection timeout in seconds

| handler.connectionLimit
| Set the maximum simultaneous incoming connections for this service

| handler.connectionLimitPerIP
| Set the maximum simultaneous incoming connections per IP for this service

| handler.handlerchain
| This loads the core CommandHandlers. Only remove this if you really know what you are doing.

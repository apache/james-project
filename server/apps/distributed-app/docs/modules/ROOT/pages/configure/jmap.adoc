= Distributed James Server &mdash; jmap.properties
:navtitle: jmap.properties

https://jmap.io/[JMAP]  is intended to be a new standard for email clients to connect to mail
stores. It therefore intends to primarily replace IMAP + SMTP submission. It is also designed to be more
generic. It does not replace MTA-to-MTA SMTP transmission.

Consult this link:https://github.com/apache/james-project/blob/master/server/apps/distributed-app/sample-configuration/jmap.properties[example]
to get some examples and hints.

.jmap.properties content
|===
| Property name | explanation

| enabled
| true/false. Governs whether JMAP should be enabled

| jmap.port
| Optional. Defaults to 80. The port this server will be listening on. This value must be a valid
port, ranging between 1 and 65535 (inclusive)

| tls.keystoreURL
| Keystore to be used for generating authentication tokens for password authentication mechanism.
This should not be the same keystore than the ones used by TLS based protocols.

| tls.secret
| Password used to read the keystore

| jwt.publickeypem.url
| Optional. Coma separated list of RSA public keys URLs to validate JWT tokens allowing requests to bypass authentication.
Defaults to an empty list.

| url.prefix
| Optional. Configuration urlPrefix for JMAP routes. Default value: http://localhost.

| websocket.url.prefix
| Optional. URL for JMAP WebSocket route. Default value: ws://localhost

| email.send.max.size
| Optional. Configuration max size for message created in both JMAP Draft amd RFC-8621.
Default value: None. Supported units are B (bytes) K (KB) M (MB) G (GB).

| upload.max.size
| Optional. Configuration max size Upload in new JMAP-RFC-8621.
Default value: 30M. Supported units are B (bytes) K (KB) M (MB) G (GB).

| view.email.query.enabled
| Optional boolean. Defaults to false. Should simple Email/query be resolved against a Cassandra projection, or should we resolve them against ElasticSearch?
This enables a higher resilience, but the projection needs to be correctly populated.

| user.provisioning.enabled
| Optional boolean. Defaults to true. Governs whether authenticated users that do not exist locally should be created in the users repository.


| authentication.strategy.draft
| Optional List[String] with delimiter `,` . Specify which authentication strategies system admin want to use for JMAP draft server.
The implicit package name is `org.apache.james.jmap.http`. If you have a custom authentication strategy outside this package, you have to specify its FQDN.
If no authentication strategy is specified, JMAP draft server will fallback to default strategies:
`AccessTokenAuthenticationStrategy`, `JWTAuthenticationStrategy`, `QueryParameterAccessTokenAuthenticationStrategy`

| authentication.strategy.rfc8621
| Optional List[String] with delimiter `,` . Specify which authentication strategies system admin want to use for JMAP RFC-8621 server.
The implicit package name is `org.apache.james.jmap.http`. If you have a custom authentication strategy outside this package, you have to specify its FQDN.
If no authentication strategy is specified, JMAP RFC-8621 server will fallback to default strategies:
`JWTAuthenticationStrategy`, `BasicAuthenticationStrategy`.

| jmap.version.default
| Optional string. Defaults to draft. Allowed values: draft, rfc-8621.
Which version of the JMAP protocol should be served when none supplied in the Accept header.
Defaults to draft for legacy reasons (avoid breaking changes) but setting the value to
rfc-8621 allow compatibility with other third party apps.

| dynamic.jmap.prefix.resolution.enabled
| Optional boolean. Defaults to false. Supported Jmap session endpoint returns dynamic prefix in response.
When its config is true, and the HTTP request to Jmap session endpoint has a `X-JMAP-PREFIX` header with the value `http://new-domain/prefix`,
then `apiUrl, downloadUrl, uploadUrl, eventSourceUrl, webSocketUrl` in response will be changed with a new prefix. Example: The `apiUrl` will be "http://new-domain/prefix/jmap".
If the HTTP request to Jmap session endpoint has the `X-JMAP-WEBSOCKET-PREFIX` header with the value `ws://new-domain/prefix`,
then `capabilities."urn:ietf:params:jmap:websocket".url` in response will be "ws://new-domain/prefix/jmap/ws".

== Wire tapping

Enabling *TRACE* on `org.apache.james.jmap.wire` enables reactor-netty wiretap, logging of
all incoming and outgoing requests, outgoing requests. This will log also potentially sensible information
like authentication credentials.

== Generating a JWT key pair

The Distributed server enforces the use of RSA-SHA-256.

One can use OpenSSL to generate a JWT key pair :

    # private key
    openssl genrsa -out rs256-4096-private.rsa 4096
    # public key
    openssl rsa -in rs256-4096-private.rsa -pubout > rs256-4096-public.pem

The private key can be used to generate JWT tokens, for instance
using link:https://github.com/vandium-io/jwtgen[jwtgen]:

    jwtgen -a RS256 -p rs256-4096-private.rsa 4096 -c "sub=bob@domain.tld" -e 3600 -V

This token can then be passed as `Bearer` of the `Authorization` header :

    curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $token" -XPOST http://127.0.0.1:80/jmap -d '...'

The public key can be referenced as `jwt.publickeypem.url` of the `jmap.properties` configuration file.

== Annotated specification

The [annotated documentation](https://github.com/apache/james-project/tree/master/server/protocols/jmap-rfc-8621/doc/specs/spec)
presents the limits of the JMAP RFC-8621 implementation part of the Apache James project. We furthermore implement
[JSON Meta Application Protocol (JMAP) Subprotocol for WebSocket](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8887).

Some methods / types are not yet implemented, some implementations are naive, and the PUSH is not supported yet.

Users are invited to read these limitations before using actively the JMAP RFC-8621 implementation, and should ensure their
client applications only uses supported operations.

Contributions enhancing support are furthermore welcomed.

The list of tested JMAP clients are:

 - [OpenPaaS](https://open-paas.org/) is actively using the draft version of the JMAP implementation. Migration to
 RFC-8621 is planned.
 - Experiments had been run on top of [LTT.RS](https://github.com/iNPUTmice/lttrs-android). Version in the Accept
 headers needs to be explicitly set to `rfc-8621`. [Read more](https://github.com/linagora/james-project/pull/4089).

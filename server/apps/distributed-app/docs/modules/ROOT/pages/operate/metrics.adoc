= Distributed James Server &mdash; Metrics
:navtitle: Metrics

James relies on the https://metrics.dropwizard.io/4.1.2/manual/core.html[Dropwizard metric library]
for keeping track of some core metrics of James.

Such metrics are made available via JMX. You can connect for instance using VisualVM and the associated
mbean plugins.

We also support displaying them via https://grafana.com/[Grafana]. Two methods can be used to back grafana display:

 - Prometheus metric collection - Data are exposed on a HTTP endpoint for Prometheus scrape.
 - ElasticSearch metric collection - This method is depreciated and will be removed in next version.
 
== Expose metrics for Prometheus collection

To enable James metrics, add ``extensions.routes`` to https://github.com/apache/james-project/blob/master/server/apps/distributed-app/docs/modules/ROOT/pages/configure/webadmin.adoc[webadmin.properties] file:
```
extensions.routes=org.apache.james.webadmin.dropwizard.MetricsRoutes
```
Connect to james-admin url to test the result: 
....
http://james-admin-url/metrics
....

== Configure Prometheus Data source
You need to set up https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/getting_started/[Prometheus] first to scrape James metrics. +
Add Apache James WebAdmin Url or IP address to ``prometheus.yaml`` configuration file:
....
scrape_configs:
  # The job name is added as a label `job=<job_name>` to any timeseries scraped from this config.
  - job_name: 'WebAdmin url Example'
    scrape_interval: 5s
    metrics_path: /metrics
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['james-webamin-url']
  - job_name: 'WebAdmin IP Example'
    scrape_interval: 5s
    metrics_path: /metrics
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['192.168.100.10:8000'] 
....

== Connect Prometheus to Grafana

You can do this either from https://prometheus.io/docs/visualization/grafana/[Grafana UI] or from a https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/datasources/prometheus/[configuration file]. +
The following `docker-compose.yaml` will help you install a simple Prometheus/ Grafana stack :
       
```
version: '3'
#Metric monitoring
  grafana:
    image: grafana/grafana:latest
    container_name: grafana
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"

  prometheus:
    image: prom/prometheus:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "9090:9090"
    volumes:
      - ./conf/prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
```

== Getting dashboards
Now that the Promtheus/Grafana servers are up, go to this https://github.com/apache/james-project/tree/master/server/grafana-reporting/prometheus-datasource/[link] to get all dashboards JSON file. Import the different JSON files in this directory to Grafana via UI.

*Note: For communication between multiple docker-compose projects, see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38088279/communication-between-multiple-docker-compose-projects[here] for example. An easier approach is to merge James and Metric docker-compose files together.

== Expose metrics for Elasticsearch collection

The following command allow you to run a fresh grafana server :

....
docker run -i -p 3000:3000 grafana/grafana
....

Once running, you need to set up an ElasticSearch data-source : - select
proxy mode - Select version 2.x of ElasticSearch - make the URL point
your ES node - Specify the index name. By default, it should be :

....
[james-metrics-]YYYY-MM
....

Import the different dashboards you want.

You then need to enable reporting through ElasticSearch. Modify your
James ElasticSearch configuration file accordingly. To help you doing
this, you can take a look to
link:https://github.com/apache/james-project/blob/3.7.x/server/apps/distributed-app/sample-configuration/elasticsearch.properties[elasticsearch.properties].

If some metrics seem abnormally slow despite in depth database
performance tuning, feedback is appreciated as well on the bug tracker,
the user mailing list or our Gitter channel (see our
http://james.apache.org/#second[community page]) . Any additional
details categorizing the slowness are appreciated as well (details of
the slow requests for instance).

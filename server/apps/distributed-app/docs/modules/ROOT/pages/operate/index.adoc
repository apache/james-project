= Distributed James Server &mdash; Operate the Distributed server
:navtitle: Operate the Distributed server

The following pages detail how to operate the Distributed server.

Once you have a Distributed James server up and running you then need to ensure it operates correctly and has a decent performance.
You may also need to perform some operation maintenance or recover from incidents. This section covers
these topics.

Read more about xref:operate/logging.adoc[Logging].

The xref:operate/webadmin.adoc[WebAdmin Restfull administration API] is the
recommended way to operate the Distributed James server. It allows managing and interacting with most
server components.

The xref:operate/cli.adoc[Command line interface] allows to interact with some
server components. However it relies on JMX technologies and its use is discouraged.

The xref:operate/metrics.adoc[metrics] allows to build latency and throughput
graphs, that can be visualized, for instance in *Grafana*.

We did put together a xref:operate/guide.adoc[detailed guide] for
distributed James operators.

We also included a guide for xref:operate/migrating.adoc[migrating existing data] into the distributed server.

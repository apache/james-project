= Distributed James Server &mdash; Migrating existing data
:navtitle: Migrating existing data

This page presents how operators can migrate your user mailbox and mails into the Distributed Server in order to adopt it.

We assume you have a xref:configure/index.adoc[well configured] running Distributed server
at hand. We also assume existing mails are hosted on a tier mail server which can be accessed via IMAP and supports
impersonation.

First, you want to create the domains handled by your server, as  well as the users you will be hosting. This operation
can be performed via WebAdmin or the CLI.

 * Using webadmin :
 ** Read xref:operate/webadmin.adoc#_create_a_domain[this section] for creating domains
 ** Read xref:operate/webadmin.adoc#_create_a_user[this section] for creating users
 * Using the CLI :
 ** Read xref:operate/cli.adoc#_manage_domains[this section] for creating domains
 ** Read xref:operate/cli.adoc#_manage_users[this section] for creating users

Second, you want to allow an administrator account of your Distributed Server to have write access on other user mailboxes.
This can be setted up this the *administratorId* configuration option of the xref:configure/usersrepository.adoc[usersrepository.xml] configuration file.

Then, it is time to run https://github.com/imapsync/imapsync[imapsync] script to copy the emails from the previous mail server
into the Distributed Server. Here is an example migrating a single user, relying on impersonation:

....
imapsync --host1 previous.server.domain.tld \
    --user1 user@domain.tld --authuser1 adminOldServer@domain.tld \
    --proxyauth1 --password1  passwordOfTheOldAdmin \
    --host2 distributed.james.domain.tld \
    --user2 use1@domain.tld  \
    --authuser2 adminNewServer@domain.tld --proxyauth2 \
    --password2  passwordOfTheNewAdmin
....

 - link:https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8030.html[RFC-8030] Web PUSH: JMAP enable sending push notifications through a push gateway.

https://jmap.io/[JMAP]  is intended to be a new standard for email clients to connect to mail
stores. It therefore intends to primarily replace IMAP + SMTP submission. It is also designed to be more
generic. It does not replace MTA-to-MTA SMTP transmission.

The link:https://github.com/apache/james-project/tree/master/server/protocols/jmap-rfc-8621/doc/specs/spec[annotated documentation]
presents the limits of the JMAP RFC-8621 implementation part of the Apache James project.

Some methods / types are not yet implemented, some implementations are naive, and the PUSH is not supported yet.

Users are invited to read these limitations before using actively the JMAP RFC-8621 implementation, and should ensure their
client applications only uses supported operations.

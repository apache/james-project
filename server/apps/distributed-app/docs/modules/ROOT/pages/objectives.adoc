= Distributed James Server &mdash; Objectives and motivation
:navtitle: Objectives and motivation

The objective of the Distributed Server is to provided facilities to execute
an advanced, extendable, and distributed email system. It is intended for
organization with serious requirements, such as high-throughput or very large
data sets.

Scaling emails infrastructure is a notoriously hard problem. The intent of the Distributed server is
to implement a mail server using modern NoSQL technologies. It relies on:

* Object Storage enables scalable yet cheap storage of large amount of data
* The use of NoSQL for metadata storage enables vertical scalability
* Finally a Distributed search engine enables quick and efficient search

Replication, data availability are thus handled by battle tested technologies.

Such a data storage strategy enables:

* A centralized management of all server components, as each Distributed James server hold the same view on data.
* A better load and data repartition between email servers, as each James servers can cary out any tasks.
* Easy scaling. Handling more users or more data is as easy as adding James instances and scaling the underlying
databases.
* Easier load-balancing, as any email server can handle requests from any user. No sharding is involved.
* Rich feature, especially regarding *sharing*. Every user can delegate access to any over users.

Furthermore, this server is intended to be easily customisable so that it can easily be adapted to ones needs.

* Several packaged extensions can be xref:configure/index.adoc#_for_extensions[configured]
* It is easy to write and load xref:extending/index.adoc[your own extensions]

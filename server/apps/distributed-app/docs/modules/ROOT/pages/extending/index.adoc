= Distributed James Server &mdash; Extending server behavior
:navtitle: Extending server behavior

== Available extension mechanisms

image::mail-processing-hexagons.png[Extension mechanisms for the Distributed Server]

The Distributed Server exposes several interfaces allowing the user to write custom extensions in
order to extend the Distributed Server behavior.

Writing *Mailets* and *Matchers* allows one to supply custom components for the
xref:extending/mail-processing.adoc[Mail Processing] and
enables to take decisions, and implement your business logic at the transport level.

Writing xref:extending/mailbox-listeners.adoc[Mailbox listeners] enables to
react to your user interaction with their mailbox. This powerful tool allows build advanced features
for mail delivery servers.

Writing xref:extending/smtp-hooks.adoc[SMTP hookd] enables to
add features to your SMTP server.

Writing xref:extending/webadmin-routes.adoc[WebAdmin routes] enables to
add features to the WebAdmin REST API.

== Handling injections for your extensions

=== Injecting core components

You can very easily inject core components into your custom extensions.

All you need is to pass them via a constructor annotated via *@Inject*.

For instance:

....
public class MyMailet extends GenericMailet {
    private final UsersRepository usersRepository;

    @Inject
    public MyMailet(UsersRepository usersRepository) {
        this.usersRepository = usersRepository;
    }

    @Override
    public void service(Mail mail) throws MessagingException {
        // Do something
    }
}
....

=== Injecting simple extension components

Furthermore, concrete implementation, that are part of your extension, can be injected as well.

Consider the following example:

....

public class MyService {

}

public class MyMailet extends GenericMailet {
    private final MyService myService;

    @Inject
    public MyMailet(MyService myService) {
        this.usersRepository = myService;
    }

    @Override
    public void service(Mail mail) throws MessagingException {
        // Do something
    }
}
....

=== Defining custom injections for your extensions

However, to inject an interface into your extension, you will need additional injection definitions.

To to so:

 * 1. Given an interface defined in a additional JAR:

....
public interface MyService {}
....

 * 2. And an implementation of that interface, in another additional JAR:

....
public class MyServiceImpl extends MyService {}
....

 * 3. We need to define a binding for MyService to be bound to MyServiceImpl

....
public class MyServiceModule extends AbstractModule {
    @Override
    protected void configure() {
        bind(MyServiceImpl.class).in(Scopes.SINGLETON);
        bind(MyService.class).to(MyServiceImpl.class);
    }
}
....

Both *MyService*, *MyServiceImpl* and *MyServiceModule* needs to be in the *extensions-jars*
folder (potentially different jars).

 * 4. *MyServiceModule* needs to be registered in xref:configure/extensions.adoc[*extensions.properties*]

 * 5. *MyService* can then be used as part of your extensions

....
public class MyMailet extends GenericMailet {
    private final MyService myService;

    @Inject
    public MyMailet(MyService myService) {
        this.usersRepository = myService;
    }

    @Override
    public void service(Mail mail) throws MessagingException {
        // Do something
    }
}
....

Note that overriding injection definitions of the Distributed Server for your injections is not supported.

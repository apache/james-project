== Secrets for James Helm template

Helm James has many secret values to configure before being able to use
it correctly. Those secrets are linked to the template through their
declaration in `james-secrets.yaml`. A sample with dumb secrets can be
found in the `secrets.sample.yaml` file.

This document presents a quick description of each secret field.

=== jwtPublicKey

Use `openssl` to generate self-signed certificate and convert to Java
Key Store JKS. You can find an example
https://loneidealist.medium.com/generating-signing-certificates-with-openssl-and-converting-to-java-key-store-jks-3c8185dbf8fe[here]

=== DKIM

To generate DKIM, you can follow our guide:
https://james.apache.org/howTo/dkim.html[howTo Dkim]

=== External secrets

Some declared secrets in `james-deployment.yaml` are external to the
James configuration. They are often being created by other components
like RabbitMQ or Cassandra. You need to have those setup before
installing the Helm James package.

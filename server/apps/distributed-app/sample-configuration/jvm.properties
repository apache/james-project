# ============================================= Extra JVM System Properties ===========================================
# To avoid clutter on the command line, any properties in this file will be added as system properties on server start.

# Example: If you need an option -Dmy.property=whatever, you can instead add it here as
# my.property=whatever

# (Optional). String (size, integer + size units, example: `12 KIB`, supported units are bytes KIB MIB GIB TIB). Defaults to 100KIB.
# This governs the threshold MimeMessageInputStreamSource relies on for storing MimeMessage content on disk.
# Below, data is stored in memory. Above data is stored on disk.
# Lower values will lead to longer processing time but will minimize heap memory usage. Modern SSD hardware
# should however support a high throughput. Higher values will lead to faster single mail processing at the cost
# of higher heap usage.
#james.message.memory.threshold=12K

# Optional. Boolean. Defaults to false. Recommended value is false.
# Should MimeMessageWrapper use a copy of the message in memory? Or should bigger message exceeding james.message.memory.threshold
# be copied to temporary files?
#james.message.usememorycopy=false

# Mode level of resource leak detection. It is used to detect a resource not be disposed of before it's garbage-collected.
# Example `MimeMessageInputStreamSource`
# Optional. Allowed values are: none, simple, advanced, testing
#   - none: Disables resource leak detection.
#   - simple: Enables output a simplistic error log if a leak is encountered and would free the resources (default).
#   - advanced: Enables output an advanced error log implying the place of allocation of the underlying object and would free resources.
#   - testing: Enables output an advanced error log implying the place of allocation of the underlying object and rethrow an error, that action is being taken by the development team.

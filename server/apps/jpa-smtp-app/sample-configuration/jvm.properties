# ============================================= Extra JVM System Properties ===========================================
# To avoid clutter on the command line, any properties in this file will be added as system properties on server start.

# Example: If you need an option -Dmy.property=whatever, you can instead add it here as
# my.property=whatever

# (Optional). String (size, integer + size units, example: `12 KIB`, supported units are bytes KIB MIB GIB TIB). Defaults to 100KIB.
# This governs the threshold MimeMessageInputStreamSource relies on for storing MimeMessage content on disk.
# Below, data is stored in memory. Above data is stored on disk.
# Lower values will lead to longer processing time but will minimize heap memory usage. Modern SSD hardware
# should however support a high throughput. Higher values will lead to faster single mail processing at the cost
# of higher heap usage.
#james.message.memory.threshold=12K

# Optional. Boolean. Defaults to false. Recommended value is false.
# Should MimeMessageWrapper use a copy of the message in memory? Or should bigger message exceeding james.message.memory.threshold
# be copied to temporary files?
#james.message.usememorycopy=false

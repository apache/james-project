#  DO NOT USE IT AS SUCH AND ADAPT IT TO YOUR NEEDS

# Configuration file for OpenSearch
# Read https://james.apache.org/server/config-opensearch.html for further details

opensearch.masterHost=opensearch
opensearch.port=9200

# Optional. Only http or https are accepted, default is http
# opensearch.hostScheme=http

# Optional, default is `default`
# Choosing the SSL check strategy when using https scheme
# default: Use the default SSL TrustStore of the system.
# ignore: Ignore SSL Validation check (not recommended).
# override: Override the SSL Context to use a custom TrustStore containing ES server's certificate.
# opensearch.hostScheme.https.sslValidationStrategy=default

# Optional. Required when using 'https' scheme and 'override' sslValidationStrategy
# Configure OpenSearch rest client to use this trustStore file to recognize nginx's ssl certificate.
# You need to specify both trustStorePath and trustStorePassword
# opensearch.hostScheme.https.trustStorePath=/file/to/trust/keystore.jks

# Optional. Required when using 'https' scheme and 'override' sslValidationStrategy
# Configure OpenSearch rest client to use this trustStore file with the specified password.
# You need to specify both trustStorePath and trustStorePassword
# opensearch.hostScheme.https.trustStorePassword=myJKSPassword

# Optional. default is `default`
# Configure OpenSearch rest client to use host name verifier during SSL handshake
# default: using the default hostname verifier provided by apache http client.
# accept_any_hostname: accept any host (not recommended).
# opensearch.hostScheme.https.hostNameVerifier=default

# Optional.
# Basic auth username to access opensearch.
# Ignore opensearch.user and opensearch.password to not be using authentication (default behaviour).
# Otherwise, you need to specify both properties.
# opensearch.user=elasticsearch

# Optional.
# Basic auth password to access opensearch.
# Ignore opensearch.user and opensearch.password to not be using authentication (default behaviour).
# Otherwise, you need to specify both properties.
# opensearch.password=secret

# You can alternatively provide a list of hosts following this format :
# opensearch.hosts=host1:9200,host2:9200
# opensearch.clusterName=cluster

opensearch.nb.shards=5
opensearch.nb.replica=1
opensearch.index.waitForActiveShards=1
opensearch.retryConnection.maxRetries=7
opensearch.retryConnection.minDelay=3000
# Index or not attachments (default value: true)
opensearch.indexAttachments=true

# Search overrides allow resolution of predefined search queries against alternative sources of data
# and allow bypassing opensearch. This is useful to handle most resynchronisation queries that
# are simple enough to be resolved against Cassandra.
#
# Possible values are:
#  - `org.apache.james.mailbox.cassandra.search.AllSearchOverride` Some IMAP clients uses SEARCH ALL to fully list messages in
# a mailbox and detect deletions. This is typically done by clients not supporting QRESYNC and from an IMAP perspective
# is considered an optimisation as less data is transmitted compared to a FETCH command. Resolving such requests against
# Cassandra is enabled by this search override and likely desirable.
#  - `org.apache.james.mailbox.cassandra.search.UidSearchOverride`. Same as above but restricted by ranges.
#  - `org.apache.james.mailbox.cassandra.search.DeletedSearchOverride`. Find deleted messages by looking up in the relevant Cassandra
# table.
#  - `org.apache.james.mailbox.cassandra.search.DeletedWithRangeSearchOverride`. Same as above but limited by ranges.
#  - `org.apache.james.mailbox.cassandra.search.NotDeletedWithRangeSearchOverride`. List non deleted messages in a given range.
# Lists all messages and filters out deleted message thus this is based on the following heuristic: most messages are not marked as deleted.
#  - `org.apache.james.mailbox.cassandra.search.UnseenSearchOverride`. List unseen messages in the corresponding cassandra projection.
#
# Please note that custom overrides can be defined here.
#
# opensearch.search.overrides=org.apache.james.mailbox.cassandra.search.AllSearchOverride,org.apache.james.mailbox.cassandra.search.DeletedSearchOverride, org.apache.james.mailbox.cassandra.search.DeletedWithRangeSearchOverride,org.apache.james.mailbox.cassandra.search.NotDeletedWithRangeSearchOverride,org.apache.james.mailbox.cassandra.search.UidSearchOverride,org.apache.james.mailbox.cassandra.search.UnseenSearchOverride

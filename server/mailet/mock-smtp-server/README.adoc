= James Mock SMTP server

This is our custom made Mock SMTP server that we use for some of our tests in James.

== Dockerized Mock SMTP server

Compile and build the image into a tarball with maven:

    $ mvn package

*Note* : You can add the option '-DskipTests' if you want to skip tests

After Jib created the image, you can load it into Docker with:

    $ docker load --input target/jib-mock-smtp-server.tar

Then run it with:

    $ docker run --rm -p 25:25 -p 8000:8000 linagora/mock-smtp-server

Where ports:

* 25 : SMTP
* 8000 : HTTP interface for setting mock SMTP server behavior

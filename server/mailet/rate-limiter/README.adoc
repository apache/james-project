= Rate limiting for Apache James

This maven module provide a James extension allowing one to enforce rate limiting for Apache James email processing.

== Running rate limiting with the memory implementation

 - 1. Compile this project.
 - 2. Place the generated "jar with dependencies" in James `extensions-jars` folder.
 - 3. Configure James to use the memory implementation for Rate Limiting by putting the following content within
`extension.properties`:

----
guice.extension.module=org.apache.james.rate.limiter.memory.MemoryRateLimiterModule
----

 - 4. Use the rate limiting mailets within `mailetcontainer.xml`

We provide a sample `docker-compose` demonstrating this setup.

== Mailets

=== PerSenderRateLimit

*PerSenderRateLimit* allows defining and enforcing rate limits for the sender of matching emails.

This allows writing rules like:

 - A sender can send 10 emails per hour
 - A sender can send email to a total of 20 recipients per hour
 - A sender can send 100 MB of emails (total computed taking only the email size into account) per hour
 - A sender can send 200 MB of emails (total computed taking each recipient copies into account) per hour

Depending on its position and the matcher it is being combined with, those rate limiting rules could be applied to
submitted emails, received emails or emitted email being relayed to third parties.

Here are supported configuration parameters:

 - *keyPrefix*: An optional key prefix to apply to rate limiting. Choose distinct values if you specify
 this mailet twice within your `mailetcontainer.xml` file. Defaults to none.
 - *exceededProcessor*: Processor to which emails whose rate is exceeded should be redirected to. Defaults to error.
 Use this to customize the behaviour upon exceeded rate.
 - *duration*: Duration during which the rate limiting shall be applied. Compulsory, must be a valid duration of at least one second. Supported units includes s (second), m (minute), h (hour), d (day).
 - *count*: Count of emails allowed for a given sender during duration. Optional, if unspecified this rate limit is not applied.
 - *recipients*: Count of recipients allowed for a given sender during duration. Optional, if unspecified this rate limit is not applied.
 - *size*: Size of emails allowed for a given sender during duration (each email count one time, regardless of recipient count). Optional, if unspecified this rate limit is not applied. Supported units : B ( 2^0 ), K ( 2^10 ), M ( 2^20 ), G ( 2^30 ), defaults to B.
 - *totalSize*: Size of emails allowed for a given sender during duration (each recipient of the email email count one time). Optional, if unspecified this rate limit is not applied. Supported units : B ( 2^0 ), K ( 2^10 ), M ( 2^20 ), G ( 2^30 ), defaults to B. Note that
   totalSize is limited in increments of 2exp(31) - ~2 billions: sending a 10MB file to more than 205 recipients will be rejected if this parameter is enabled.


For instance, to apply all the examples given above:

----
<mailet matcher="All" class="PerSenderRateLimit">
    <keyPrefix>myPrefix</keyPrefix>
    <duration>1h</duration>
    <count>10</count>
    <recipients>20</recipients>
    <size>100M</size>
    <totalSize>200M</totalSize>
</mailet>

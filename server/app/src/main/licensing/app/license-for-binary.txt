   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

            Conditioned upon Your compliance with Section 3.1 below and
            subject to third party intellectual property claims, the
            Initial Developer hereby grants You a world-wide,
            royalty-free, non-exclusive license:
            
            (a) under intellectual property rights (other than
            patent or trademark) Licensable by Initial Developer,
            to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform,
            sublicense and distribute the Original Software (or
            portions thereof), with or without Modifications,
            and/or as part of a Larger Work; and
            
            (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making,
            using or selling of Original Software, to make, have
            made, use, practice, sell, and offer for sale, and/or
            otherwise dispose of the Original Software (or
            portions thereof).
            
            (c) The licenses granted in Sections 2.1(a) and (b)
            are effective on the date Initial Developer first
            distributes or otherwise makes the Original Software
            available to a third party under the terms of this
            License.
            
            (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent
            license is granted: (1) for code that You delete from
            the Original Software, or (2) for infringements
            caused by: (i) the modification of the Original

            2.2. Contributor Grant.
            
            Conditioned upon Your compliance with Section 3.1 below and
            subject to third party intellectual property claims, each
            Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
            non-exclusive license:
            
            (a) under intellectual property rights (other than
            patent or trademark) Licensable by Contributor to
            use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense
            and distribute the Modifications created by such
            Contributor (or portions thereof), either on an
            unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as
            Covered Software and/or as part of a Larger Work; and
            
            (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making,
            using, or selling of Modifications made by that
            Contributor either alone and/or in combination with
            its Contributor Version (or portions of such
            combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale,
            have made, and/or otherwise dispose of: (1)
            Modifications made by that Contributor (or portions
            thereof); and (2) the combination of Modifications
            made by that Contributor with its Contributor Version
            (or portions of such combination).
            
            (c) The licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and

            available to a third party.
            
            (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent
            license is granted: (1) for any code that Contributor
            has deleted from the Contributor Version; (2) for
            infringements caused by: (i) third party

            Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the
            absence of Modifications made by that Contributor.
            
            3. Distribution Obligations.
            
            3.1. Availability of Source Code.
            
            Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make
            available in Executable form must also be made available in
            Source Code form and that Source Code form must be
            distributed only under the terms of this License. You must
            include a copy of this License with every copy of the
            Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or
            otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any
            such Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can
            obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form in a
            reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used
            for software exchange.
            
            3.2. Modifications.
            
            The Modifications that You create or to which You
            contribute are governed by the terms of this License. You
            represent that You believe Your Modifications are Your
            original creation(s) and/or You have sufficient rights to
            grant the rights conveyed by this License.
            
            3.3. Required Notices.
            
            You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications
            that identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification.
            You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or
            trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, or
            any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving
            attribution to any Contributor or the Initial Developer.
            
            3.4. Application of Additional Terms.
            
            You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered
            Software in Source Code form that alters or restricts the
            applicable version of this License or the recipients'
            rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a
            fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
            obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software.
            However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
            behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You
            must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty,
            support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by
            You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
            Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred
            by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of
            warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
            
            3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.
            
            You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered
            Software under the terms of this License or under the terms
            of a license of Your choice, which may contain terms
            different from this License, provided that You are in
            compliance with the terms of this License and that the
            license for the Executable form does not attempt to limit
            or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code form
            from the rights set forth in this License. If You
            distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a
            different license, You must make it absolutely clear that
            any terms which differ from this License are offered by You
            alone, not by the Initial Developer or Contributor. You
            hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
            Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial
            Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms
            You offer.
            
            3.6. Larger Works.
            
            You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software
            with other code not governed by the terms of this License
            and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such
            a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License
            are fulfilled for the Covered Software.
            
            4. Versions of the License.
            
            4.1. New Versions.
            
            Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and
            may publish revised and/or new versions of this License
            from time to time. Each version will be given a
            distinguishing version number. Except as provided in
            Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has the
            right to modify this License.
            
            4.2. Effect of New Versions.
            
            You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise
            make the Covered Software available under the terms of the
            version of the License under which You originally received
            the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a
            notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being
            distributed or otherwise made available under any
            subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and
            make the Covered Software available under the terms of the
            version of the License under which You originally received
            the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to
            use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software
            available under the terms of any subsequent version of the
            License published by the license steward.
            
            4.3. Modified Versions.
            
            When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a
            new license for Your Original Software, You may create and
            use a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename
            the license and remove any references to the name of the
            license steward (except to note that the license differs
            from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that
            the license contains terms which differ from this License.
            
            5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
            
            COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS"
            BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
            INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED
            SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR
            PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
            PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY
            COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE
            INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF
            ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF
            WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF
            ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS
            DISCLAIMER.
            
            6. TERMINATION.
            
            6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will
            terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms
            herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of
            becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by their
            nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of
            this License shall survive.
            
            6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding
            declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or
            a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against
            whom You assert such claim is referred to as "Participant")
            alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the
            Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor
            or the Original Software where the Participant is the
            Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any
            patent, then any and all rights granted directly or
            indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial
            Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant)
            and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this
            License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant
            terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration
            of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day
            period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the
            Participant Software against such Participant either
            unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with
            Participant.
            
            6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2
            above, all end user licenses that have been validly granted
            by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination
            (excluding licenses granted to You by any distributor)
            shall survive termination.
            
            7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
            
            UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
            (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE
            INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF
            COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE
            LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR
            CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
            LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK
            STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
            COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
            INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF
            LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL
            INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT
            APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO
            NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR
            CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT
            APPLY TO YOU.
            
            8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.
            
            The Covered Software is a "commercial item," as that term is
            defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial
            computer software" (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. ?
            252.227-7014(a)(1)) and "commercial computer software
            documentation" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept.
            1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1
            through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users
            acquire Covered Software with only those rights set forth herein.
            This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes,
            any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses
            Government rights in computer software under this License.
            
            9. MISCELLANEOUS.
            
            This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
            matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
            unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the
            extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be
            governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice
            contained within the Original Software (except to the extent
            applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such
            jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation
            relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of
            the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a
            notice contained within the Original Software, with the losing
            party responsible for costs, including, without limitation, court
            costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The
            application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
            International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or
            regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall
            be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.
            You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the
            United States export administration regulations (and the export
            control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use,
            distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.
            
            10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
            
            As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
            responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or
            indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License
            and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to
            distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing
            herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission
            of liability.

            NOTICE; LIMITED LICENSE GRANTS
            
            1. License for Purposes of Evaluation and Developing Applications. Licensor hereby grants 
               you a fully-paid, non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide, limited license (without the 
               right to sublicense), under Licensor's applicable intellectual property rights to view, 
               download, use and reproduce the Specification only for the purpose of internal evaluation. 
               This includes developing applications intended to run on an implementation of the 
               Specification provided that such applications do not themselves implement any portion(s) 
               of the Specification.
            
            2. License for the Distribution of Compliant Implementations. Licensor also grants you a 
               perpetual, non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide, fully paid-up, royalty free, limited 
               license (without the right to sublicense) under any applicable copyrights or, subject to 
               the provisions of subsection 4 below, patent rights it may have covering the Specification 
               to create and/or distribute an Independent Implementation of the Specification that:
                
                  (a) fully implements the Specification including all its required interfaces and 
                      functionality; 
                  (b) does not modify, subset, superset or otherwise extend the Licensor Name Space, 
                      or include any public or protected packages, classes, Java interfaces, fields 
                      or methods within the Licensor Name Space other than those required/authorized 
                      by the Specification or Specifications being implemented; and 
                  (c) passes the Technology Compatibility Kit (including satisfying the requirements 
                      of the applicable TCK Users Guide) for such Specification ("Compliant Implementation"). 
                      In addition, the foregoing license is expressly conditioned on your not acting 
                      outside its scope. No license is granted hereunder for any other purpose (including, 
                      for example, modifying the Specification, other than to the extent of your fair use 
                      rights, or distributing the Specification to third parties).
            
            3. Pass-through Conditions. You need not include limitations (a)-(c) from the previous paragraph
               or any other particular "pass through" requirements in any license You grant concerning the 
               use of your Independent Implementation or products derived from it. However, except with 
               respect to Independent Implementations (and products derived from them) that satisfy 
               limitations (a)-(c) from the previous paragraph, You may neither: 
               
                   (a) grant or otherwise pass through to your licensees any licenses under Licensor's 
                       applicable intellectual property rights; nor 
                   (b) authorize your licensees to make any claims concerning their implementation's 
                       compliance with the Specification.
            
            4. Reciprocity Concerning Patent Licenses. With respect to any patent claims covered by the 
               license granted under subparagraph 2 above that would be infringed by all technically 
               feasible implementations of the Specification, such license is conditioned upon your 
               offering on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms, to any party seeking it from 
               You, a perpetual, non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide license under Your patent 
               rights that are or would be infringed by all technically feasible implementations of the 
               Specification to develop, distribute and use a Compliant Implementation.
            
            5. Definitions. For the purposes of this Agreement: "Independent Implementation" shall mean an 
               implementation of the Specification that neither derives from any of Licensor's source code 
               or binary code materials nor, except with an appropriate and separate license from Licensor, 
               includes any of Licensor's source code or binary code materials; "Licensor Name Space" shall 
               mean the public class or interface declarations whose names begin with "java", "javax", 
               "javax.jcr" or their equivalents in any subsequent naming convention adopted by Licensor 
               through the Java Community Process, or any recognized successors or replacements thereof; 
               and "Technology Compatibility Kit" or "TCK" shall mean the test suite and accompanying TCK 
               User's Guide provided by Licensor which corresponds to the particular version of the 
               Specification being tested.
            
            6. Termination. This Agreement will terminate immediately without notice from Licensor if 
               you fail to comply with any material provision of or act outside the scope of the licenses 
               granted above.
            
            7. Trademarks. No right, title, or interest in or to any trademarks, service marks, or trade 
               names of Licensor is granted hereunder. Java is a registered trademark of Sun Microsystems, 
               Inc. in the United States and other countries.
            
            8. Disclaimer of Warranties. The Specification is provided "AS IS". LICENSOR MAKES NO 
               REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, 
               WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT 
               (INCLUDING AS A CONSEQUENCE OF ANY PRACTICE OR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SPECIFICATION), 
               OR THAT THE CONTENTS OF THE SPECIFICATION ARE SUITABLE FOR ANY PURPOSE. This document 
               does not represent any commitment to release or implement any portion of the Specification 
               in any product.
            
               The Specification could include technical inaccuracies or typographical errors. Changes are 
               periodically added to the information therein; these changes will be incorporated into new 
               versions of the Specification, if any. Licensor may make improvements and/or changes to the 
               product(s) and/or the program(s) described in the Specification at any time. Any use of such 
               changes in the Specification will be governed by the then-current license for the applicable 
               version of the Specification.
            
            9. Limitation of Liability. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR 
               BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOST REVENUE, PROFITS OR DATA, OR 
               FOR SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED AND 
               REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO ANY FURNISHING, 
               PRACTICING, MODIFYING OR ANY USE OF THE SPECIFICATION, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED 
               OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
            
            10. Report. If you provide Licensor with any comments or suggestions in connection with your 
                use of the Specification ("Feedback"), you hereby: (i) agree that such Feedback is provided 
                on a non-proprietary and non-confidential basis, and (ii) grant Licensor a perpetual, 
                non-exclusive, worldwide, fully paid-up, irrevocable license, with the right to sublicense 
                through multiple levels of sublicensees, to incorporate, disclose, and use without 
                limitation the Feedback for any purpose related to the Specification and future versions, 
                implementations, and test suites thereof.

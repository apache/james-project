        This configuration file allows you to customize the way quota are handled on this server.
        You need to rename it in quota.xml so that it gets interpreted by James on startup.

        The different configuration options are detailed here.

        Read RFC-2087 for full details.

<quota>
    <!--
        Quota implementation is based on several components :
          - QuotaRootResolver : In regard of quota management, mailboxes forms abstract groups called QUOTA ROOT. This
          component finds to which QUOTA ROOT a mailbox belongs
          - Current quota manager : Counters for current values : how many messages belongs to this quota root ? Which
          size ?
          - Max Quota manager : Sets a maximum value QUOTA ROOT resources can not exceed.
          - QuotaManager : assemble Current quota manager and Max quota manager.
          - Listening quota updater : Event system based quota update. On each APPED / COPY /EXPUNGE command, current
          quotas gets updated.
    -->

        Possible value :

    <currentQuotaManager>
        <!--
        Possible value for provider :
         - none : when you use fake as a value for quotaManager's provider
         - inmemory
         - cassandra

        The inmemory implementation :
         - Does not work in a distributed context
        Note that quota need to be (lazy) re-calculated after each starts

        Cassandra implementation.
        Non existing quota are considered as null. No cache. It needs to be always enabled, or you might get some
        quota synchronisation issues.

        <provider>none</provider>
    </currentQuotaManager>
    <maxQuotaManager>
        <!--
        This component is exposed to the CLI for quota administration tasks.

        Possible value are :
         - fake : will always return UNLIMITED. Throws on modifications.
         - fixed : all QUOTA ROOT get the same upper bound for their quotas.
         - inmemory : allows you to define QUOTA ROOT specific limits, backed with a fixed policy. It does not
         work in a distributed context.
         - cassandra : Same thing than inmemory but backed on cassandra. Works on a distributed context. Note that using
         the default* configuration options and the CLI to set default options is dangerous as server startup might override
         CLI values.

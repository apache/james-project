RUN FROM IDE
============

If you want to run James App (the main class, or a test) from your favorite IDE,
the JPA classes will need to be enhanced by openjpa, so add the following option 
to the VM argument of your run configuration (replace MY_HOME_FOLDER with your real home folder):

'-javaagent:MY_HOME_FOLDER/.m2/repository/org/apache/openjpa/openjpa/2.2.1/openjpa-2.2.1.jar'

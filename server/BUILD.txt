################## GENERAL BUILDING NOTES ############

######################################################

The primary build tool for James server is maven 3 (3.0.2 is required).

On a new source checkout from https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/james/ start by running
$ mvn package

This will compile all modules and build the distribution.
The distribution binary and source build can be found under "container/spring/target" 
and should contain everything you need to start with.

For just building without running junit tests:
$ mvn package -DskipTests=true

Some tests have been disabled by default (*TestLive.java) because they
are not reliable enough for continuous integration testing. To run the
full set of tests, do:
$ mvn install -Plivetests

= Guice-Memory Module How-to

== Building

=== Requirements

 * Java 8 SDK
 * Docker
 * Maven

=== Building the artifacts

An usual compilation using maven will produce two artifacts into target directory :

 * james-server-memory-guice-${version}.jar
 * james-server-memory-guice-${version}.lib

== Running

=== James Launch

To run james, you have to create a directory containing required configuration files.

A sample directory (appropriately named sample-directory) is provided with some
default values you may need to replace.

You also need to generate a keystore with the following command :
[source]
----
$ keytool -genkey -alias james -keyalg RSA -keystore conf/keystore
----

Once everything is set up, you just have to run the jar with :

[source]
----
$ java -Dworking.directory=sample-configuration -jar target/james-server-memory-guice-${version}.jar
----

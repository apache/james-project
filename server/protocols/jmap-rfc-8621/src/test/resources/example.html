    <h3>Why a new Logo?<a name="Why_a_new_Logo"></a></h3>


    <p>We are happy with our current logo, but for the
        upcoming James Server 3.0 release, we would like to
        give our community the opportunity to create a new image for James.</p>


    <p>Don't be shy, take your inkscape and gimp, and send us on
        the <a href="mail.html">James Server User mailing list</a>
        your creations. We will publish them on this page.</p>


    <p>We need an horizontal logo (100p height) to be show displayed on the upper
        left corner of this page, an avatar (48x48p) to be used on a Twitter stream for example.
        The used fonts should be redistributable (or commonly available on Windows and Linux).
        The chosen logo should be delivered in SVG format.
        We also like the <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/press/kit/">Apache feather</a>.</p>

Tassos Papadopoulos, the Greek sculptor behind the plan, judged that the
 limestone of Mount Kerdylio, 70 miles east of Salonika and not far from the
 Mount Athos monastic community, was ideal for the patriotic sculpture. 
 
 As well as Alexander's granite features, 240 ft high and 170 ft wide, a
 museum, a restored amphitheatre and car park for admiring crowds are
planned
---------------------
So is this mountain limestone or granite?
If it's limestone, it'll weather pretty fast.

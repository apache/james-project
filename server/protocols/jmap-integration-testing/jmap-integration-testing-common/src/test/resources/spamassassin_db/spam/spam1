Greetings!

You are receiving this letter because you have expressed an interest in 
receiving information about online business opportunities. If this is 
erroneous then please accept my most sincere apology. This is a one-time 
mailing, so no removal is necessary.

If you've been burned, betrayed, and back-stabbed by multi-level marketing, 
MLM, then please read this letter. It could be the most important one that 
has ever landed in your Inbox.

MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING IS A HUGE MISTAKE FOR MOST PEOPLE

MLM has failed to deliver on its promises for the past 50 years. The pursuit 
of the "MLM Dream" has cost hundreds of thousands of people their friends, 
their fortunes and their sacred honor. The fact is that MLM is fatally 
flawed, meaning that it CANNOT work for most people.

The companies and the few who earn the big money in MLM are NOT going to 
tell you the real story. FINALLY, there is someone who has the courage to 
cut through the hype and lies and tell the TRUTH about MLM.

HERE'S GOOD NEWS

There IS an alternative to MLM that WORKS, and works BIG! If you haven't yet 
abandoned your dreams, then you need to see this. Earning the kind of income 
you've dreamed about is easier than you think!

With your permission, I'd like to send you a brief letter that will tell you 
WHY MLM doesn't work for most people and will then introduce you to 
something so new and refreshing that you'll wonder why you haven't heard of 
this before.

I promise that there will be NO unwanted follow up, NO sales pitch, no one 
will call you, and your email address will only be used to send you the 
information. Period.

To receive this free, life-changing information, simply click Reply, type 
"Send Info" in the Subject box and hit Send. I'll get the information to you 
within 24 hours. Just look for the words MLM WALL OF SHAME in your Inbox.

Cordially,

Siddhi

P.S. Someone recently sent the letter to me and it has been the most 
eye-opening, financially beneficial information I have ever received. I 
honestly believe that you will feel the same way once you've read it. And 
it's FREE!

Feature: Mailbox creation and sharing
  As a James user
  I don't want other user to create mailbox in my mailbox even I shared it to them

  Background:
    Given a domain named "domain.tld"
    And some users "alice@domain.tld", "bob@domain.tld"
    And "alice@domain.tld" has a mailbox "shared"
    And "alice@domain.tld" shares her mailbox "shared" with "bob@domain.tld" with "aeilrwt" rights

  Scenario: A sharee should not be able to create a shared mailbox child
    Given "bob@domain.tld" creates mailbox "sharedChild" with creationId "c-01" in mailbox "shared" owned by "alice@domain.tld"
    When "alice@domain.tld" lists mailboxes
    Then the mailboxes should contain "shared" in "Personal" namespace

  Scenario: A sharee should receive a not created response when trying to create a shared mailbox child
    When "bob@domain.tld" creates mailbox "sharedChild" with creationId "c-01" in mailbox "shared" owned by "alice@domain.tld"
    Then mailbox with creationId "c-01" is not created

Feature: Copy message and sharing
  As a James user
  I want that copying message work correctly with shared folder

  Background:
    Given a domain named "domain.tld"
    And some users "alice@domain.tld", "bob@domain.tld"
    And "alice@domain.tld" has a mailbox "shared"
    And "alice@domain.tld" shares her mailbox "shared" with "bob@domain.tld" with "aeilrwt" rights
    And "bob@domain.tld" has a mailbox "bobMailbox"
    And "alice@domain.tld" has a message "m1" in "INBOX" mailbox
    And "bob@domain.tld" has a message "m2" in "bobMailbox" mailbox

  Scenario: Copy message should update the total and the unread counts when asked by sharer
    Given "alice@domain.tld" copies "m1" from mailbox "INBOX" to mailbox "shared"
    When "alice@domain.tld" lists mailboxes
    Then the mailbox "shared" has 1 message
    And the mailbox "shared" has 1 unseen message

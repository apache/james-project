  <title>Apache James Server 3 - Provided SMTP Hooks</title>
 </properties>

<body>

  <section name="Provided Hooks in James Server">
  
    <p>The following hooks are supported:</p>

    <subsection name="AuthHook">
      <p>Allows to hook in your code for authenticate users for sending mail via SMTP AUTH. 
      You could for example query your own database table to see if a user should be allowed to 
      send mail with the given username and password.</p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection name="ConnectionHandler">
      <p>Allows to hook in your code on a new connection. So you could just drop it 
      or do something else.</p>
    </subsection>
 
    <subsection name="HeloHook">
      <p>Allows to hook in your code in the HELO and EHLO commands.</p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection name="MailHook">
      <p>Allows to hook in your code in the MAIL command. Like checking the sender 
      which was given with MAIL FROM: &lt;whatever@example&gt;</p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection name="MailParametersHook">
      <p>Allows to hook in given parameters in the EHLO command.</p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection name="JamesMessageHook">
      <p>Allow to hook in your code after the email was received via the DATA command and 
         was marked for queuing by the CLRF.CRLF sequence. This will get executed right before 
         the message will actual get queued.</p>
      <p>IMPORTANT: If you want to do heavy processing here 
         and not want to reject the method based on a criteria you are most times better of to 
         use the Mailet API!</p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection name="QuitHook">
      <p>Allow to hook in your code in the QUIT command.</p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection name="RcptHook">
      <p>Allows to hook in your code in the RCPT command. Like implementing a custom logic to 
      check if the mail for a given recipient should get accepted or rejected.</p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection name="UnknownCmdHook">
      <p>Allows to hook in your code on every unknown command.</p>
    </subsection>

    <subsection name="MailPriorityHandler">
      <p>Allows to set priority on mails for the spool queues, depending on the destination domain.</p>
    </subsection>
    
    <subsection name="HookResultJMXMonitor">
      <p>Allows to register a HookStatsMBean under JMX for every processed Hook. 
         You will get statistics about the configured hooks via JMX </p>

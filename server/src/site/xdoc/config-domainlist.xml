  <title>Apache James Server 3 - DomainList Configuration</title>
 </properties>

<body>

  <section name="DomainList Configuration">

    <p>Consult <a href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/james/server/trunk/app/src/main/resources/domainlist-template.xml">domainlist-template.xml</a> in SVN to get some examples and hints.</p>
    
      <p>This configuration block is defined by the <strong>domainlist</strong> tag.</p>
      
      <p>You must specify the DomainList class as attribute of the domainlist tag (org.apache.james.domainlist.jpa.JPADomainList, or org.apache.james.domainlist.xml.XMLDomainList, or...)</p> 

      <dl>
        <dt><strong>domainnames</strong></dt>
        <dd>Domainnames identifies the DNS namespace served by this instance of James. 
These domainnames are used for both matcher/mailet processing and SMTP auth 
to determine when a mail is intended for local delivery - Only applicable for XMLDomainList.</dd>
        <dt><strong>autodetect</strong></dt>
        <dd>true or false - If autodetect is true, James wil attempt to discover its own host name AND 
use any explicitly specified servernames. 
If autodetect is false, James will use only the specified domainnames.</dd>
        <dt><strong>autodetectIP</strong></dt>
        <dd>true or false - If autodetectIP is not false, James will also allow add the IP address for each servername. 
The automatic IP detection is to support RFC 2821, Sec 4.1.3, address literals.</dd>
        <dt><strong>defaultDomain</strong></dt>
        <dd>Set the default domain which will be used if an email is send to a recipient without a domain part.
            If not defaultdomain is set the first domain of the DomainList get used.</dd>
      </dl>

<p>To override autodetected domainames names simply add explicit domainname elements.
In most cases this will be necessary. By default, the domainname 'localhost' is specified. This can be removed, if required.</p>

<p>Warning: If you are using fetchmail it is important to include the 
fetched domains in the server name list to prevent looping.</p>

    <title>Apache James Server 3 - Queue Priority</title>
  </properties>

<body>

  <section name="Priority in the Spooling Queues">
  
    <p>Priority is supported when James (de)queues the mails during the spooling process.</p>
    
    <p>For this just add a Mail attribute with name "MAIL-PRIORITY" to the mail you send.</p>

    <p>This mail header should use one of the following value:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>0 for LOW-PRIORITY</li>
      <li>5 for NORMAL-PRIORITY (default)</li> 
      <li>9 for HIGH-PRIORITY</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>Default priority if no MAIL-PRIORITY attribute set is NORMAL-PRIORITY.</p>
    
  </section>
  
  <section name="Usage Scenario">
  
    <p>There are two scenarios to set priority in the queue.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Write a <a href="dev-extend-smtp-hook.html">SMTP hook</a> which sets the header 
         and add the hook to smtphandler chain.</li>
      <li>You could also add the header in a mailet to let remotedelivery 
          pick it up again on redelivery.</li>
    </ul>

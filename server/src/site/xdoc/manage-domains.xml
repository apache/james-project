  <title>Apache James Server 3 - Manage Domains</title>
 </properties>

<body>

  <section name="Manage Domains">
  
    <p>Domain accounts are shared across services.  A common Domain repository is shared across James 
       services.  That is, once you've created a POP3 mail and set a password, that same 
       is available for authenticated SMTP and NNTP.</p>
    
    <p>If you have JPADomainList (default setup), you can add, delete and list the domains.</p>
    
    <p>If you have XMLDomainList for example, you can only list the available domains. To add a domain,
       you must add it in the domainlist.xml file.</p>

  </section>

  <section name="Manage Domains via Cli">
  
    <p>Invoke "james-cli.sh adddomain &lt;mydomain.tls&gt; &lt;mydomain.tls&gt; is the domain name 
      of the domain you wish to create.</p>
      
    <p>That's it.  Your domains are now created and can be used by all James services.</p>
    
  </section>

  <section name="Manage Domains via JMX">
  
    <p>Use and JMX client to access the DomainList management function.</p>
  
    <p>The managed objects are exposed from localhost only (for security reasons) on the following URL:</p>
      
    <p><code>service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://localhost:9999/jmxrmi</code></p>
      
    <p>If you want a remote access, you can install a web application management tool such as jmanage. 
       You will get screens such as the following one.</p>

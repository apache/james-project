                <a href='http://james.apache.org/mailet/base'>Apache James Mailets Base</a>
                collects a number of utilities and lightweight frameworks useful when working with the
                <a href='http://james.apache.org/mailet/api'>Apache Mailet API</a>
                (a framework assisting the rapid development of email processing functionality).
                Mailets base is used as the basis for the email processing functions shipped with the
                <a href='http://james.apache.org/server'>Apache James</a>
                server but is not dependent on that server.

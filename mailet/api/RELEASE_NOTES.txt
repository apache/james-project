                     Apache Mailet API
                     -----------------
                     

The Apache Mailet API is a Java API which allows the rapid development 
and flexible deployment of email processing functionality. A mailet is
a mail processing component which can be composed with others to create
flexible mail processing applications. Matchers allow the conditional 
application of mailets based on mail qualities.

Apache James uses mailets extensively to provide flexible and powerful
mail processing. The Mailet API is independent of James and mailets
can run in any complaint container.

/**
 * This interface defines the behaviour of the message "routing" inside
 * the mailet container. At its heart is the {@link #match(Mail)} method,
 * which inspects a Mail and returns a subset of its recipients which meet
 * this Matcher's criteria.
 * <p>
 * An important feature of the mailet container is the ability to fork
 * processing of messages. When a message first arrives at the server,
 * it might have multiple recipients specified. When a message is passed
 * to a matcher, the matcher might only match some of the listed recipients.
 * The mailet container should then duplicate the message, splitting the
 * recipient list across the two messages as per the match result, and
 * proceed to process them separately.
 * <p>
 * The Matcher life cycle is controlled by the mailet container,
 * which invokes the Matcher methods in the following order:
 * <ol>
 * <li>The matcher is constructed.
 * <li>The {@link #init} method is invoked once to initialize the matcher.
 * <li>The {@link #match} method is invoked to match mail messages.
 *     This can occur an unlimited number of times, even concurrently.
 * <li>At some point, such as when the mailet container is shut down,
 *     the matcher is taken out of service and then destroyed by invoking
 *     the {@link #destroy} method once.
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * In addition to the life-cycle methods, this interface provides the
 * {@link #getMatcherConfig} method, which provides the Matcher with
 * its configuration information and a {@link MailetContext} through which
 * it can interact with the mailet container, and the {@link #getMatcherInfo}
 * method, which provides basic information about the Matcher.

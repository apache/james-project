<BODY>

<p>This package and its sub-packages extend and provide utilities for use with
<code>javax.mail</code>, its sub-packages and its implementations.
</p>
<p>The intent is to mirror the related package structures where possible.
So, <code>org.apache.utils.mail</code> is a mirror of <code>javax.mail</code> and
<code>org.apache.utils.mail.handlers</code> is a mirror of <code>com.sun.mail.handlers</code>.

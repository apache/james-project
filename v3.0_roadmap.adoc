= Road map for James 3.0

This document aims at dividing existing and upcoming code into the following categories :

 - supported
 - experimental
 - unsupported

== MISC

We need to choose a new Logo.

We need a better website.

== Mailbox section

.Feature matrix : mailbox backend
|===
|Feature name |Status | Comment

|JPA
|supported
|Already existing code

|Memory
|Unsupported
|Reference for testing

|Cassandra
|experimental
|Essentially we do not know about how performance will behave. Also consistency issues might arise.

|ElasticSearch
|supported
|

|HBase
|unsupported
|

|JCR
|unsupported
|

|Lucene
|unsupported
|

|Caching
|unsupported
|

|Maildir
|unsupported
|Known issue on MailboxPath handling

|===

What being "supported implies for a backend ?

 - Being MPT tested
 - Deployment tests part of unit tests (ex : cassandra-guice)
 - Having support for domain names, users and rewrite tables in server/data/data-@backend@
 - Having its mappers passing generic unit tests for mappers
 - It should at least support USER_FLAGS feature on MPT tests
 - Be able to handle a constant gatling workload for at least 4 hours with constant latency
 - Be tested with thunderbird (we should write scenari for that)


.Feature matrix : mailbox capabilities
|===
|Feature name |Status | Comment

|ACL
|unsupported
|

|Shared mailbox
|unsupported
|

|Quota
|experimental
|

|User flags
|supported
|

|Distributed events
|Unsupported
|

|===

=== Short note about what needs to be DONE

**General** :

 - Define Thunderbird scenari
 - Write Gatling tests for IMAP

**JPA** :

 - We need JPA to valid MessageMapper and MailboxMapper unit tests.

Bonus : have quota support with JPA...

== Server

.Injection framework
|===
|Name |Status

|Guice JPA
|Supported

|Spring
|Supported

|Guice cassandra
|experimental

|Guice memory
|experimental

|Cluster deployment
|unsupported
|===

We need tests to ensure James starts when Spring is used.

.Components
|===
|Name |Status |Comment

|ActiveMQ mail queue
|supported
|

|Camel mail processing
|supported
|

|Sieve
|experimental
|Problem : it is compulsory today to rely on SIEVE scripts upon message reception

|Mailets
|experimental / supported
|If need be, I can add the details on mailet
|===

=== What to do ?

Write a JPA Guice project.

Integration test on Spring. We need to ensure it starts in JPA flavour with some supported components.

Write a LocalDelivery mailet variant that do not rely on SieveMailet, to make SIEVE use truly optional.

== Protocols

.Protocols
|===
|Name |Status |Comment

|IMAP
|supported
|See details on IMAP extensions below

|SMTP
|supported
|Lack some integration tests, I guess

|POP3
|Unsupported
|

|ManageSIEVE
|Unsupported
|

|JMAP
|Experimental
|

|LMTP
|supported
|


|FetchMail
|Unsupported
|
|===


.IMAP extensions
|===
|Header 1 |Header 2 |Header 3

|RFC-2087 Quota
|experimental
|

|RFC-4314 ACLs
|Unsupported
|

|RFC-5464 Metadatas
|Unsupported
|

|RFC-3051 IMAP4 rev1
|supported
|Following https://james.apache.org/protocols/imap4.html

|RFC-2342 Namespace
|unsupported
|Following https://james.apache.org/protocols/imap4.html it is implemented. However we do not see any test of this. Even if it works, as there is no proper ACL support, activating it is dangerous.

|RFC-2177 IDLE
|supported
|Following https://james.apache.org/protocols/imap4.html

|RFC-4551 CONDSTORE
|supported
|Following https://james.apache.org/protocols/imap4.html

|RFC-5162 Resynch
|supported
|Following https://james.apache.org/protocols/imap4.html Implemented, enabled, but no MPT tests

|===

=== What to do ?

 - I should be able to choose exposed IMAP commands
 - More SMTP integration tests
 - NAMESPACE, and interacting with other user mailboxes should not be allowed
 - MPT tests for RFC-5162 Resynch

== Mailet and matcher

=== mailet

==== General remarks

 - I do not fully understand the differences between Bounces, Resend, Redirect, Forward, etc... We might have some duplicates there....
 - RemoteDelivery should have SMTP part extracted as a service in my opinion. And at least more tests.
 - Lack of tests in general. Supported mailets should have unit tests.
 - Documentation outdated for /server/mailet + parameters for mailets needs some more investigations
 - Remove duplicates for AI mailets

==== Concise list

Underlined means "no tests"... (22 supported, 4 experimental, 18 unsupported)

Supported : AddFooter, AddSubjectPrefix, LogMessage, MailAttrToMimeHeaders, Null, RemoveAllMailAttributes, RemoveMailAttributes,
RemoveMimeHeader, ReplaceSubject, SetMailAttribute, SetMimeHeader, ToProcessor, __Bounce__, __Forward__, LocalDelivery,
__NotifyPostmaster__, __NotifySender__, __RRT__, __Redirect__, __RemoteDelivery__, __Resend__, __ToRepository__

Experimental : __ClamAVScan__, __RecipientToLowerCase__, __SpamAssassin__, __SPF__

Unsupported : __AddHabeasWarrantMark__, __ClassifyBounces__, __HeadersToHttp__, __RecoverAttachement__, __SerializeToHttp__,
__ServerTime__, __StripAttachement__, UnWrapText, __UseHeaderRecipient__, __WrapText__, __BayesianAnalysisFeeder__,
__BayesianAnalysis__, __FromRepository__, __JDBCAlias__, __JDBCRRT__, __ToRecipientFolder__, __ToSenderFolder__,
__WhiteListManager__

=== matcher

=== General remarks

 - Lack of tests in general. Supported matchers should have unit tests.
 - Integration tests on SMTP relay rules... (I know we have troubles here)

=== Concise list

Underlined means "no tests"... (28 supported, 3 experimental, 14 unsupported)

Supported : All, HasAttribute, HasAttributeValue, __HasHeader__, HasAttributeRegex, HostIs, HostIsLocal, IsSingleRecipient,
RecipientIs, RecipientIsRegex, __RecipientIsLocal__, RelayLimit, __SenderHostIs__, __SenderHostIsLocal__, SenderIsNull,
SenderIs, SenderIsRegex, __SenderIsLocal__, SizeGreaterThan, SMTPAuthSuccess, SMTPAuthUserIs, SMTPIsAuthNetwork,
SubjectIs, SubjectStartsWith, UserIs, RemoteAddrInNetwork, RemoteAddrNotInNetwork, __SenderInFakeDomain__

Experimental : __HasAttachement__, __IsOverQuota__, InSpammerBlacklist

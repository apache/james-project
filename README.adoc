== What is James?

*James* stands for *Java Apache Mail Enterprise Server!*

It has a modular architecture based on a rich set of *modern* and *efficient* components which provides at the end
*complete, stable, secure and extendable Mail Servers running on the JVM*.

Create your *own personal solution* for emails treatment by assembling the components you need thanks to the Inversion
of Control mail platform offered and  go further customizing filtering and routing rules using *James Mailet Container*.

Supported protocols are: IMAP, SMTP, JMAP, POP3 and more...

== How to try James

Requirements: docker & docker-compose installed.

When you try James this way, you will use the most current state of James.
It will be configured to run with Cassandra & ElasticSearch.
All those three components will be started with a single command.

You can retrieve the docker-compose file :

    $ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/james-project/master/dockerfiles/run/docker-compose.yml

Then, you just have to start the services:

    $ docker-compose up

Wait a few seconds in order to have all those services start up. You will see the following log when James is available:
james           | Started : true

A default domain, james.local, has been created. You can see this by running:

    $ docker exec james java -jar /root/james-cli.jar -h 127.0.0.1 -p 9999 listdomains

James will respond to IMAP port 143 and SMTP port 25.
You have to create users before playing with james. You may also want to create other domains.
Follow the 'Useful commands' section for more information about James CLI.


== How to check the compilation

In order to have a standard compilation environment, we introduce Dockerfiles, using java-11.

=== Java 11

First step, you have to build the Docker image

    $ docker build -t james/project dockerfiles/compilation/java-11

In order to run the build, you have to launch the following command:

    $ docker run -v $PWD/.m2:/root/.m2 -v $PWD:/origin -t james/project -s SHA1

Where:

- $PWD/.m2:/root/.m2: is the first volume used to share the maven repository,
as we don't want to download all dependencies on each build

- SHA1 (optional): is the given git SHA1 of the james-project repository to build or master if none.
- -s option: given tests will not be played while building. Not specifying means play tests.

To retrieve compiled artifacts, one might mount these volumes:

- --volume $PWD/dockerfiles/run/spring/destination:/spring/destination : is the volume used to get the compiled elements for Spring packaging.
- --volume $PWD/dockerfiles/run/guice/cassandra/destination:/cassandra/destination : is the volume used to get the compiled elements for Guice Cassandra packaging and Cassandra-LDAP packaging.
- --volume $PWD/dockerfiles/run/guice/jpa/destination:/jpa/destination : is the volume used to get the compiled elements for Guice JPA packaging.
- --volume $PWD/swagger:/swagger : is the volume used to get the swagger json files for webadmin documentation.

Some tests needs a DOCKER_HOST environment variable in order to be played, they will be ignored if you don't provide this variable.
If you wish to play them, you may use a command like the following (depending on your docker configuration):

    $ docker run --env DOCKER_HOST=tcp://172.17.0.1:2376 -v $PWD/.m2:/root/.m2 -v $PWD:/origin -v $PWD/dockerfiles/run/spring/destination:/destination -t james/project SHA1

If you are using a a fresh installation of Docker, your DOCKER_HOST should be unix:///var/run/docker.sock and you should mount this socket as a volume:

    $ docker run --env DOCKER_HOST=unix:///var/run/docker.sock -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v $PWD/.m2:/root/.m2 -v $PWD:/origin -v $PWD/dockerfiles/run/spring/destination:/destination -t james/project SHA1


== How to run James in Docker

This feature is available for three configurations :

 * link:#run-james-with-guice-%2Dcassandra-%2Drabbitmq-%2Ds3-%2Delasticsearch[Guice + Cassandra + RabbitMQ + S3 + ElasticSearch]
 * link:#run-james-with-guice-%2Dcassandra-%2Delasticsearch[Guice + Cassandra + ElasticSearch]
 * link:#run-james-with-guice-%2Djpa-%2Dlucene[Guice + JPA + Lucene]
 * link:#run-james-with-spring-%2Djpa[Spring + JPA]


=== Run James with Guice + Cassandra + RabbitMQ + S3 + ElasticSearch


==== Requirements
Built artifacts should be in ./dockerfiles/run/guice/cassandra-rabbitmq/destination folder for cassandra.
If you haven't already:

    $ docker build -t james/project dockerfiles/compilation/java-11
    $ docker run -v $HOME/.m2:/root/.m2 -v $PWD:/origin \
  -v $PWD/dockerfiles/run/guice/cassandra-rabbitmq/destination:/cassandra-rabbitmq/destination \
  -t james/project -s HEAD


==== How to ?
You need a running *cassandra* in docker. To achieve this run:

    $ docker run -d --name=cassandra cassandra:3.11.3

You need a running *rabbitmq* in docker. To achieve this run:

    $ docker run -d --name=rabbitmq rabbitmq:3.8.1-management

You need a running *s3* compatible objectstorage in docker. To achieve this run:

    $ docker run -d --env 'REMOTE_MANAGEMENT_DISABLE=1' --env 'SCALITY_ACCESS_KEY_ID=accessKey1' --env 'SCALITY_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=secretKey1' --name=s3 zenko/cloudserver:8.2.6

You need a running *ElasticSearch* in docker. To achieve this run:

    $ docker run -d --name=elasticsearch --env 'discovery.type=single-node' docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:6.3.2

If you want to handle attachment text extraction before indexing in ElasticSearch (this makes attachments searchable)
and if you want to use all the JMAP search capabilities, you also need to start *Tika*.
See http://james.apache.org/server/config-elasticsearch.html#Tika_Configuration[Tika configuration documentation] for more info.

    $ docker run -d --name=tika apache/tika:1.24

We need to provide the key we will use for TLS. For obvious reasons, this is not provided in this git.

Copy your TLS keys to `run/guice/cassandra-rabbitmq/destination/conf/keystore` or generate it using the following command. The password must be `james72laBalle` to match default configuration.

    $ keytool -genkey -alias james -keyalg RSA -keystore dockerfiles/run/guice/cassandra-rabbitmq/destination/conf/keystore

Then we need to build james container :

    $ docker build -t james_run dockerfiles/run/guice/cassandra-rabbitmq

To run this container :

    $ docker run --hostname HOSTNAME -p "25:25" -p 80:80 -p "110:110" -p "143:143" -p "465:465" -p "587:587" -p "993:993" -p "127.0.0.1:8000:8000" --link cassandra:cassandra --link rabbitmq:rabbitmq
   --link elasticsearch:elasticsearch --link tika:tika --link s3:s3.docker.test --name james_run -t james_run

Where :

- HOSTNAME is the hostname you want to give to your James container. This DNS entry will be used to send mail to your James server.
- link to tika is only needed if you started tika earlier.

Webadmin port binding is restricted to loopback as users are not authenticated by default on webadmin server. Thus you should avoid exposing it in production.
Note that the above example assumes `127.0.0.1` is your loopback interface for convenience but you should change it if this is not the case on your machine.

If you want to pass additional options to the underlying java command, you can configure a _JVM_OPTIONS_ env variable, for example add:

    --env JVM_OPTIONS="-Xms256m -Xmx2048m"

To have log file accessible on a volume, add *-v  $PWD/logs:/logs* option to the above command line, where *$PWD/logs* is your local directory to put files in.

==== Instrumentation
You can use Glowroot to instrumentalize James. The provided guice docker files allow a simple way to do it.
In order to activate Glowroot you need to run the container with the environment variable _GLOWROOT_ACTIVATED_ set to _true_
and to expose the glowroot instrumentation ui port.

    --env GLOWROOT_ACTIVATED=true -p "4000:4000"

By default, the Glowroot UI is accessible from every machines in the network as defined in the _destination/admin.json_.
Which you could configure before building the image, if you want to restrict its accessibility to localhost for example.
See the https://github.com/glowroot/glowroot/wiki/Agent-Installation-(with-Embedded-Collector)#user-content-optional-post-installation-steps[Glowroot post installation steps]  for more details.

Or by mapping the 4000 port to the IP of the desired network interface, for example `-p 127.0.0.1:4000:4000`.



=== Run James with Guice + Cassandra + ElasticSearch


==== Requirements
Built artifacts should be in ./dockerfiles/run/guice/cassandra/destination folder for cassandra.
If you haven't already:

    $ docker build -t james/project dockerfiles/compilation/java-11
    $ docker run -v $HOME/.m2:/root/.m2 -v $PWD:/origin \
  -v $PWD/dockerfiles/run/guice/cassandra/destination:/cassandra/destination \
  -t james/project -s HEAD


==== How to ?
You need a running *cassandra* in docker. To achieve this run:

    $ docker run -d --name=cassandra cassandra:3.11.3

You need a running *ElasticSearch* in docker. To achieve this run:

    $ docker run -d --name=elasticsearch --env 'discovery.type=single-node' docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:6.3.2

If you want to handle attachment text extraction before indexing in ElasticSearch (this makes attachments searchable)
and if you want to use all the JMAP search capabilities, you also need to start *Tika*.
See http://james.apache.org/server/config-elasticsearch.html#Tika_Configuration[Tika configuration documentation] for more info.

    $ docker run -d --name=tika apache/tika:1.24

We need to provide the key we will use for TLS. For obvious reasons, this is not provided in this git.

Copy your TLS keys to `run/guice/cassandra/destination/conf/keystore` or generate it using the following command. The password must be `james72laBalle` to match default configuration.

    $ keytool -genkey -alias james -keyalg RSA -keystore dockerfiles/run/guice/cassandra/destination/conf/keystore

Then we need to build james container :

    $ docker build -t james_run dockerfiles/run/guice/cassandra

To run this container :

    $ docker run --hostname HOSTNAME -p "25:25" -p 80:80 -p "110:110" -p "143:143" -p "465:465" -p "587:587" -p "993:993" -p "127.0.0.1:8000:8000" --link cassandra:cassandra --link elasticsearch:elasticsearch --link tika:tika --name james_run -t james_run

Where :

- HOSTNAME is the hostname you want to give to your James container. This DNS entry will be used to send mail to your James server.
- link to tika is only needed if you started tika earlier.

Webadmin port binding is restricted to loopback as users are not authenticated by default on webadmin server. Thus you should avoid exposing it in production.
Note that the above example assumes `127.0.0.1` is your loopback interface for convenience but you should change it if this is not the case on your machine.

To have log file accessible on a volume, add *-v  $PWD/logs:/logs* option to the above command line, where *$PWD/logs* is your local directory to put files in.

=== Run James with Guice + JPA + Lucene

==== Requirements
Built artifacts should be in ./dockerfiles/run/guice/jpa/destination folder for jpa.
If you haven't already:

    $ docker build -t james/project dockerfiles/compilation/java-11
    $ docker run -v $HOME/.m2:/root/.m2 -v $PWD:/origin \
  -v $PWD/dockerfiles/run/guice/jpa/destination:/jpa/destination \
  -t james/project -s HEAD


==== How to ?
We need to provide the key we will use for TLS. For obvious reasons, this is not provided in this git.

Copy your TLS keys to `run/guice/jpa/destination/conf/keystore` or generate it using the following command. The password must be `james72laBalle` to match default configuration.

    $ keytool -genkey -alias james -keyalg RSA -keystore dockerfiles/run/guice/jpa/destination/conf/keystore


Then we need to build james container :

    $ docker build -t james_run dockerfiles/run/guice/jpa

To run this container :

    $ docker run --hostname HOSTNAME -p "25:25" -p 80:80 -p "110:110" -p "143:143" -p "465:465" -p "587:587" -p "993:993" -p "127.0.0.1:8000:8000" --name james_run -t james_run

HOSTNAME is the hostname you want to give to your James container. This DNS entry will be used to send mail to your James server.

Webadmin port binding is restricted to loopback as users are not authenticated by default on webadmin server. Thus you should avoid exposing it in production.
Note that the above example assumes `127.0.0.1` is your loopback interface for convenience but you should change it if this is not the case on your machine.

To have log file accessible on a volume, add *-v  $PWD/logs:/logs* option to the above command line, where *$PWD/logs* is your local directory to put files in.


=== Run James with Spring + JPA

==== Requirements

Built artifacts should be in ./dockerfiles/run/spring/destination folder for Spring.
If you haven't already:

    $ docker build -t james/project dockerfiles/compilation/java-11
    $ docker run -v $HOME/.m2:/root/.m2 -v $PWD:/origin \
  -v $PWD/dockerfiles/run/spring/destination:/spring/destination \
  -t james/project -s HEAD


==== Howto ?

We need to provide the key we will use for TLS. For obvious reasons, this is not provided in this git.

Copy your TSL keys to destination/run/spring/conf/keystore or generate it using the following command. The password must be james72laBalle to match default configuration.

    $ keytool -genkey -alias james -keyalg RSA -keystore dockerfiles/run/spring/destination/conf/keystore

Then we need to build james container :

    $ docker build -t james_run dockerfiles/run/spring/

The provisioned james images bases on pre-build james server which is "linagora/james-project-spring-jpa". If we need to build james container with the default initial data (initial domain: james.local and initial users: user01, user02, user03):

    $ docker build -t james_run dockerfiles/run/spring/provisioned/

To run this container :

    $ docker run --hostname HOSTNAME -p "25:25" -p "110:110" -p "143:143" -p "465:465" -p "587:587" -p "993:993" --name james_run -t james_run

Where HOSTNAME is the hostname you want to give to your James container. This DNS entry will be used to send mail to your James server.


== Other Useful commands

The base command is different whether you choose guice flavor or spring :

  * guice use : `docker exec james_run java -jar /root/james-cli.jar`
  * spring use : `docker exec james_run /root/james-server-app-3.0.0-beta6-SNAPSHOT/bin/james-cli.sh`

=== How to add a domain ?

    # Add DOMAIN to 127.0.0.1 in your host /etc/hosts
    $ <your-command-here> -h 127.0.0.1 -p 9999 adddomain DOMAIN

DOMAIN: is the domain you want to add.

Note: Using docker, one can add an environment variable holding the domain to be created. This
domain will be created upon James start:

    $ --environment DOMAIN=domain.tld

=== How to add a user ?

    $ <your-command-here> -h 127.0.0.1 -p 9999 adduser USER_MAIL_ADDRESS PASSWORD

Where :

* USER_MAIL_ADDRESS: is the mail address that will be used by this user.
* PASSWORD: is the password that will be used by this user.

You can then just add DOMAIN to your /etc/hosts and you can connect to your james account with for instance Thunderbird.

=== How to manage SIEVE scripts ?

Each user can manage his SIEVE scripts through the manage SIEVE mailet.

To use the manage SIEVE mailet :

 * You need to create the user sievemanager@DOMAIN ( if you don't, the SMTP server will check the domain, recognize it, and look for an absent local user, and will generate an error ).
 * You can send Manage Sieve commands by mail to sievemanager@DOMAIN. Your subject must contain the command. Scripts needs to be added as attachments and need the ".sieve" extension.

To activate a script for a user, you need the following combination :

 * PUTSCRIPT scriptname
 * SETACTIVE scriptname

=== How to retrieve users and password from my previous container

Some james data (those non related to mailbox, eg : mail queue, domains, users, rrt, SIEVE scripts, mail repositories ) are not yet supported by our Cassandra implementation.

To keep these data when you run a new container, you can mount the following volume :

 -v /root/james-server-app-3.0.0-beta6-SNAPSHOT/var:WORKDIR/destination/var

Where :

* WORKDIR: is the absolute path to your james-parent workdir.

Beware : you will have concurrency issues if multiple containers are running on this single volume.

== Develop on James

James requires at least JDK 11 and Maven 3.6.0 to build.
Some parts of James are written in Scala so one might need to enable Scala plugin in IDE.

=== How to run deployment Tests

We wrote some MPT (James' Mail Protocols Tests subproject) deployment tests to validate a James
deployment.

It uses the External-James module, that uses environment variables to locate a remote
IMAP server and run integration tests against it.

For that, the target James Server needs to be configured with a domain domain and a user imapuser
with password password. Read above documentation to see how you can do this.

You have to run MPT tests inside docker. As you need to use maven, the simplest option is to
use james/parent image, and override the entry point ( as git and maven are already configured
there ) :

    $ docker run -t --entrypoint="/root/integration_tests.sh" -v $PWD/.m2:/root/.m2 -v $PWD:/origin james/project JAMES_IP JAMES_PORT SHA1

Where :

* JAMES_IP: IP address or DNS entry for your James server
* JAMES_PORT: Port allocated to James' IMAP port (should be 143).
* SHA1(optional): Branch to use in order to build integration tests or master if none.

=== How to check the merge of a commit

First step, you have to build the Docker image

    $ docker build -t james/merge dockerfiles/merge

In order to run the build, you have to launch the following command:

    $ docker run -v $PWD:/origin -t james/merge SHA1 RESULTING_BRANCH

Where :

- SHA1: is the given git SHA1 of the james-project repository to merge.
- RESULTING_BRANCH: is the branch created when merging.

== Generating a package for James

You can generate a deb package and an RPM package for James by using the following process.

First step, you have to build the Docker image used to generate the package

    $ docker build -t build-james-packages \
        --build-arg RELEASE=3.2.0 \
        --build-arg ITERATION=1 \
        --build-arg BASE=linagora/james-project \
        --build-arg BASE_LDAP=linagora/james-ldap-project \
        --build-arg BASE_RABBITMQ=linagora/james-rabbitmq-project \
        --build-arg TAG=latest \
        dockerfiles/packaging/guice/cassandra

Where:

- ITERATION is the release number used after the last hyphen (e.g. 3.0.1, 3.1.0, 3.2.0...)
- BASE is the image jar and executable are copied from. Defaults to linagora/james-project
- BASE_LDAP is the image jar and executable are copied from for a deployment with an LDAP user repository. Defaults to linagora/james-ldap-project
- BASE_RABBITMQ is the image jar and executable are copied from for a deployment of linagora/james-project + RabbitMQ + S3 BlobStore.
Defaults to linagora/james-rabbitmq-project
- TAG is the tag of these docker images. Defaults to latest.

Then, you have to run the container:

    $ docker run --name james-packages -v $PWD/result:/result build-james-packages

Where:

- $PWD/result is the folder where the deb and the RPM packages will be copied

Note: A helper script is provided for the generation of packages for a specific git commit. For instance:

    $ sh dockerfiles/packaging/guice/cassandra/package.sh 3.2.0 1 c298195e84 $PWD/result

The generated package allow you to choose between a deployment with or without LDAP using update-alternatives.
Once installed, try:

    $ update-alternatives --config james

By default James is configured without LDAP support.

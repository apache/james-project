== What is James?

*James* stands for *Java Apache Mail Enterprise Server!*

It has a modular architecture based on a rich set of *modern* and *efficient* components which provides at the end
*complete, stable, secure and extendable Mail Servers running on the JVM*.

Create your *own personal solution* for emails treatment by assembling the components you need thanks to the Inversion
of Control mail platform offered and  go further customizing filtering and routing rules using *James Mailet Container*.

Supported protocols are: IMAP, SMTP, JMAP, POP3 and more...

== How to try James

Requirements: docker & docker-compose installed.

When you try James this way, you will use the most current state of James.
It will be configured to run with Cassandra & ElasticSearch.
All those three components will be started with a single command.

You can retrieve the docker-compose file :

    $ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/james-project/master/dockerfiles/run/docker-compose.yml

Then, you just have to start the services:

    $ docker-compose up

Wait a few seconds in order to have all those services start up. You will see the following log when James is available:
james           | Started : true

A default domain, james.local, has been created. You can see this by running:

    $ docker exec james java -jar /root/james-cli.jar -h 127.0.0.1 -p 9999 listdomains

James will respond to IMAP port 143 and SMTP port 25.
You have to create users before playing with james. You may also want to create other domains.
Follow the 'Useful commands' section for more information about James CLI.


== How to check the compilation

In order to have a standard compilation environment, we introduce Dockerfiles, using java-11.

=== Maven

We require maven version 3.6.0 minimum to build the project.

Simply run `mvn clean install` within this directory to compile the project.

Useful options includes:

 - `-DskipTests` to skip the long to execute resource consuming test suite that requires a docker daemon.
 - `-T 4` to parallelize the build on several CPUs.

=== With the docker wrapper

Alternatively we provide a standard compilation environement bundled in a docker image.

First step, you have to build the Docker image

    $ docker build -t james/project dockerfiles/compilation/java-11

In order to run the build, you have to launch the following command:

    $ docker run -v $PWD/.m2:/root/.m2 -v $PWD:/origin -t james/project -s SHA1

Where:

- $PWD/.m2:/root/.m2: is the first volume used to share the maven repository,
as we don't want to download all dependencies on each build

- SHA1 (optional): is the given git SHA1 of the james-project repository to build or master if none.
- -s option: given tests will not be played while building. Not specifying means play tests.

To retrieve compiled artifacts, one might mount these volumes:

- --volume $PWD/dockerfiles/run/spring/destination:/spring/destination : is the volume used to get the compiled elements for Spring packaging.
- --volume $PWD/dockerfiles/run/guice/cassandra/destination:/cassandra/destination : is the volume used to get the compiled elements for Guice Cassandra packaging and Cassandra-LDAP packaging.
- --volume $PWD/dockerfiles/run/guice/jpa/destination:/jpa/destination : is the volume used to get the compiled elements for Guice JPA packaging.
- --volume $PWD/swagger:/swagger : is the volume used to get the swagger json files for webadmin documentation.

Some tests needs a DOCKER_HOST environment variable in order to be played, they will be ignored if you don't provide this variable.
If you wish to play them, you may use a command like the following (depending on your docker configuration):

    $ docker run --env DOCKER_HOST=tcp://172.17.0.1:2376 -v $PWD/.m2:/root/.m2 -v $PWD:/origin -v $PWD/dockerfiles/run/spring/destination:/destination -t james/project SHA1

If you are using a a fresh installation of Docker, your DOCKER_HOST should be unix:///var/run/docker.sock and you should mount this socket as a volume:

    $ docker run --env DOCKER_HOST=unix:///var/run/docker.sock -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v $PWD/.m2:/root/.m2 -v $PWD:/origin -v $PWD/dockerfiles/run/spring/destination:/destination -t james/project SHA1


== How to run James in Docker

This feature is available for three configurations :

 * link:https://github.com/apache/james-project/blob/master/server/container/guice/cassandra-rabbitmq-guice/README.adoc[Guice + Cassandra + RabbitMQ + S3 + ElasticSearch (distributed)]
 * link:https://github.com/apache/james-project/blob/master/server/container/guice/cassandra-guice/README.adoc[Guice + Cassandra + ElasticSearch]
 * link:https://github.com/apache/james-project/blob/master/server/container/guice/jpa-guice/README.adoc[Guice + JPA + Lucene]
 * link:https://github.com/apache/james-project/blob/master/server/container/guice/memory-guice/README.adoc[Guice + Memory (testing)]
 * link:#run-james-with-spring-%2Djpa[Spring + JPA]

=== Run James with Spring + JPA

==== Requirements

Built artifacts should be in ./dockerfiles/run/spring/destination folder for Spring.
If you haven't already:

    $ docker build -t james/project dockerfiles/compilation/java-11
    $ docker run -v $HOME/.m2:/root/.m2 -v $PWD:/origin \
  -v $PWD/dockerfiles/run/spring/destination:/spring/destination \
  -t james/project -s HEAD


==== Howto ?

We need to provide the key we will use for TLS. For obvious reasons, this is not provided in this git.

Copy your TSL keys to destination/run/spring/conf/keystore or generate it using the following command. The password must be james72laBalle to match default configuration.

    $ keytool -genkey -alias james -keyalg RSA -keystore dockerfiles/run/spring/destination/conf/keystore

Then we need to build james container :

    $ docker build -t james_run dockerfiles/run/spring/

The provisioned james images bases on pre-build james server which is "linagora/james-project-spring-jpa". If we need to build james container with the default initial data (initial domain: james.local and initial users: user01, user02, user03):

    $ docker build -t james_run dockerfiles/run/spring/provisioned/

To run this container :

    $ docker run --hostname HOSTNAME -p "25:25" -p "110:110" -p "143:143" -p "465:465" -p "587:587" -p "993:993" --name james_run -t james_run

Where HOSTNAME is the hostname you want to give to your James container. This DNS entry will be used to send mail to your James server.

== Other Useful commands

The base command is different whether you choose guice flavor or spring :

  * guice use : `docker exec james_run java james-cli`
  * spring use : `docker exec james_run /root/james-server-app-3.0.0-beta6-SNAPSHOT/bin/james-cli.sh`

See https://james.apache.org/server/manage-cli.html[Manage James via the Command Line] for more info.

=== How to add a domain ?

    # Add DOMAIN to 127.0.0.1 in your host /etc/hosts
    $ <your-command-here> -h 127.0.0.1 -p 9999 adddomain DOMAIN

DOMAIN: is the domain you want to add.

Note: Using docker, one can add an environment variable holding the domain to be created. This
domain will be created upon James start:

    $ --environment DOMAIN=domain.tld

=== How to add a user ?

    $ <your-command-here> -h 127.0.0.1 -p 9999 adduser USER_MAIL_ADDRESS PASSWORD

Where :

* USER_MAIL_ADDRESS: is the mail address that will be used by this user.
* PASSWORD: is the password that will be used by this user.

You can then just add DOMAIN to your /etc/hosts and you can connect to your james account with for instance Thunderbird.

=== How to manage SIEVE scripts ?

Each user can manage his SIEVE scripts through the manage SIEVE mailet.

To use the manage SIEVE mailet :

 * You need to create the user sievemanager@DOMAIN ( if you don't, the SMTP server will check the domain, recognize it, and look for an absent local user, and will generate an error ).
 * You can send Manage Sieve commands by mail to sievemanager@DOMAIN. Your subject must contain the command. Scripts needs to be added as attachments and need the ".sieve" extension.

To activate a script for a user, you need the following combination :

 * PUTSCRIPT scriptname
 * SETACTIVE scriptname

=== How to retrieve users and password from my previous container

Some james data (those non related to mailbox, eg : mail queue, domains, users, rrt, SIEVE scripts, mail repositories ) are not yet supported by our Cassandra implementation.

To keep these data when you run a new container, you can mount the following volume :

 -v /root/james-server-app-3.0.0-beta6-SNAPSHOT/var:WORKDIR/destination/var

Where :

* WORKDIR: is the absolute path to your james-parent workdir.

Beware : you will have concurrency issues if multiple containers are running on this single volume.

== Develop on James

James requires at least JDK 11 and Maven 3.6.0 to build.
Some parts of James are written in Scala so one might need to enable Scala plugin in IDE.

=== How to run deployment Tests

We wrote some MPT (James' Mail Protocols Tests subproject) deployment tests to validate a James
deployment.

It uses the External-James module, that uses environment variables to locate a remote
IMAP server and run integration tests against it.

For that, the target James Server needs to be configured with a domain domain and a user imapuser
with password password. Read above documentation to see how you can do this.

You have to run MPT tests inside docker. As you need to use maven, the simplest option is to
use james/parent image, and override the entry point ( as git and maven are already configured
there ) :

    $ docker run -t --entrypoint="/root/integration_tests.sh" -v $PWD/.m2:/root/.m2 -v $PWD:/origin james/project JAMES_IP JAMES_PORT SHA1

Where :

* JAMES_IP: IP address or DNS entry for your James server
* JAMES_PORT: Port allocated to James' IMAP port (should be 143).
* SHA1(optional): Branch to use in order to build integration tests or master if none.

=== How to check the merge of a commit

First step, you have to build the Docker image

    $ docker build -t james/merge dockerfiles/merge

In order to run the build, you have to launch the following command:

    $ docker run -v $PWD:/origin -t james/merge SHA1 RESULTING_BRANCH

Where :

- SHA1: is the given git SHA1 of the james-project repository to merge.
- RESULTING_BRANCH: is the branch created when merging.

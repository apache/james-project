Apache James Project
====================

link:https://gitter.im/apache/james-project[image:https://badges.gitter.im/apache/james-project.svg[Join the chat at link:https://gitter.im/apache/james-project]]

This is the parent module for all Apache James artifacts. It contains useful values to be inherited by other Maven projects.

* Maven plugins management section with common plugins used in the project
* URL's and mailing-lists definitions for the project

=== How to try James

Requirements: docker & docker-compose installed.

When you try James this way, you will use the most current state of James.
It will be configured to run with Cassandra & ElasticSearch.
All those three components will be started with a single command.

You can retrieve the docker-compose file :

    $ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/james-project/master/dockerfiles/run/docker-compose.yml

Then, you just have to start the services:

    $ docker-compose up

Wait a few seconds in order to have all those services start up. You will see the following log when James is available:
james           | Started : true

A default domain, james.local, has been created. You can see this by running:

    $ docker exec james java -jar /root/james-cli.jar -h 127.0.0.1 -p 9999 listdomains

James will respond to IMAP port 143 and SMTP port 25.
You have to create users before playing with james. You may also want to create other domains.
Follow the 'Useful commands' section for more information about James CLI.


=== How to build and publish the website

 1. Install Apache Maven 3.0.2+ and make its binary 'mvn' available on your PATH.
    See http://maven.apache.org/download.html#Installation.
 2. run "mvn clean site"
 3. Test the built site in your browser from the {path}/target/site folder
 4. If everything looks OK, deploy the site using "mvn clean site-deploy".
 5. Wait for the changes to replicate to the Apache web server or setup 140.211.11.10:80 as
    a proxy to review the changes (described here: http://www.apache.org/dev/project-site.html)

To deploy the technical reports use the "-Psite-reports" profile.

For wagon-ssh-external configuration see
http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-deploy-plugin/examples/deploy-ssh-external.html

You can alternatively use a docker container to build the website :

You need to build the homepage by:
    $ docker build -t james/homepage dockerfiles/site/homepage
    $ docker run -v $PWD:/origin -v $PWD/site:/destination james/homepage master
Then you build the other pages by:
    $ docker build -t james/site dockerfiles/site/website
    $ docker run -v $PWD/.m2:/root/.m2 -v $PWD:/origin -v $PWD/site:/destination james/site master

=== How to release via maven release plugin

See details on http://www.apache.org/dev/publishing-maven-artifacts.html

In short, just follow the 'standard' process:

* Prepare pom for release
* publish snapshot
* prepare release
* stage the release for a vote (don't forget to close the staging repository)
* vote
* release

Don't forget to add your key to http://www.apache.org/dist/james/KEYS

    $ ssh people.apache.org
    $ cd /www/www.apache.org/dist/james


=== How to check the compilation

In order to have a standard compilation environment, we introduce Dockerfiles, using java-8.

==== Java 8

First step, you have to build the Docker image

    $ docker build -t james/project dockerfiles/compilation/java-8

In order to run the build, you have to launch the following command:

    $ docker run -v $PWD/.m2:/root/.m2 -v $PWD:/origin -t james/project -s SHA1

Where:

- $PWD/.m2:/root/.m2: is the first volume used to share the maven repository,
as we don't want to download all dependencies on each build

- SHA1 (optional): is the given git SHA1 of the james-project repository to build or master if none.
- -s option: given tests will not be played while building. Not specifying means play tests.

To retrieve compiled artifacts, one might mount these volumes:

- --volume $PWD/dockerfiles/run/spring/destination:/spring/destination : is the volume used to get the compiled elements for Spring packaging.
- --volume $PWD/dockerfiles/run/guice/cassandra/destination:/cassandra/destination : is the volume used to get the compiled elements for Guice Cassandra packaging and Cassandra-LDAP packaging.
- --volume $PWD/dockerfiles/run/guice/cassandra/destination:/jpa/destination : is the volume used to get the compiled elements for Guice JPA packaging.
- --volume $PWD/swagger:/swagger : is the volume used to get the swagger json files for webadmin documentation.

Some tests needs a DOCKER_HOST environment variable in order to be played, they will be ignored if you don't provide this variable.
If you wish to play them, you may use a command like the following (depending on your docker configuration):

    $ docker run --env DOCKER_HOST=tcp://172.17.0.1:2376 -v $PWD/.m2:/root/.m2 -v $PWD:/origin -v $PWD/dockerfiles/run/spring/destination:/destination -t james/project SHA1

If you are using a a fresh installation of Docker, your DOCKER_HOST should be unix:///var/run/docker.sock and you should mount this socket as a volume:

    $ docker run --env DOCKER_HOST=unix:///var/run/docker.sock -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v $PWD/.m2:/root/.m2 -v $PWD:/origin -v $PWD/dockerfiles/run/spring/destination:/destination -t james/project SHA1


=== How to run James in Docker

This feature is available for three configurations :

 * Java 8 + Guice + Cassandra + ElasticSearch
 * Java 8 + Guice + JPA + Lucene
 * Java 8 + Spring + JPA


==== Run James with Java 8 + Guice + Cassandra + ElasticSearch


===== Requirements
Built artifacts should be in ./dockerfiles/run/guice/cassandra/destination folder for cassandra.
If you haven't already:

    $ docker build -t james/project dockerfiles/compilation/java-8
    $ docker run -v $HOME/.m2:/root/.m2 -v $PWD:/origin \
  -v $PWD/dockerfiles/run/guice/cassandra/destination:/cassandra/destination \
  -t james/project -s HEAD


===== How to ?
You need a running *cassandra* in docker. To achieve this run :

    $ docker run -d --name=cassandra cassandra:2.2.3

You need a running *ElasticSearch* in docker. To achieve this run :

    $ docker run -d --name=elasticsearch elasticsearch:2.2.1

We need to provide the key we will use for TLS. For obvious reasons, this is not provided in this git.

Copy your TLS keys to `run/guice/cassandra/destination/conf/keystore` or generate it using the following command. The password must be `james72laBalle` to match default configuration.

    $ keytool -genkey -alias james -keyalg RSA -keystore dockerfiles/run/guice/cassandra/destination/conf/keystore

Then we need to build james container :

    $ docker build -t james_run dockerfiles/run/guice/cassandra

To run this container :

    $ docker run --hostname HOSTNAME -p "25:25" -p 80:80 -p "110:110" -p "143:143" -p "465:465" -p "587:587" -p "993:993" --link cassandra:cassandra --link elasticsearch:elasticsearch --name james_run -t james_run

Where :

- HOSTNAME: is the hostname you want to give to your James container. This DNS entry will be used to send mail to your James server.

You can add an optional port binding to port 8000, to expose the webadmin server. Please note that users are not authenticated on webadmin server, thus you should avoid exposing it in production.

To have log file accessible on a volume, add *-v  $PWD/logs:/logs* option to the above command line, where *$PWD/logs* is your local directory to put files in.

===== Handling attachment indexing

You can handle attachment text extraction before indexing in ElasticSearch. This makes attachments searchable. To enable this:

Run tika:

    $ docker run --name tika logicalspark/docker-tikaserver:1.15rc2

Add a link for the tika container in the above command line:

    $ docker run --hostname HOSTNAME -p "25:25" -p 80:80 -p "110:110" -p "143:143" -p "465:465" -p "587:587" -p "993:993" --link cassandra:cassandra --link elasticsearch:elasticsearch --link tika:tika --name james_run -t james_run

==== Run James with Java 8 + Guice + JPA + Lucene

===== Requirements
Built artifacts should be in ./dockerfiles/run/guice/jpa/destination folder for jpa.
If you haven't already:

    $ docker build -t james/project dockerfiles/compilation/java-8
    $ docker run -v $HOME/.m2:/root/.m2 -v $PWD:/origin \
  -v $PWD/dockerfiles/run/guice/jpa/destination:/jpa/destination \
  -t james/project -s HEAD


===== How to ?
We need to provide the key we will use for TLS. For obvious reasons, this is not provided in this git.

Copy your TLS keys to `run/guice/jpa/destination/conf/keystore` or generate it using the following command. The password must be `james72laBalle` to match default configuration.

    $ keytool -genkey -alias james -keyalg RSA -keystore dockerfiles/run/guice/jpa/destination/conf/keystore


Then we need to build james container :

    $ docker build -t james_run dockerfiles/run/guice/jpa

To run this container :

    $ docker run --hostname HOSTNAME -p "25:25" -p 80:80 -p "110:110" -p "143:143" -p "465:465" -p "587:587" -p "993:993" --name james_run -t james_run

HOSTNAME is the hostname you want to give to your James container. This DNS entry will be used to send mail to your James server.

You can add an optional port binding to port 8000, to expose the webadmin server. Please note that users are not authenticated on webadmin server, thus you should avoid exposing it in production.

To have log file accessible on a volume, add *-v  $PWD/logs:/logs* option to the above command line, where *$PWD/logs* is your local directory to put files in.


==== Run James with Java 8 + Spring + JPA

===== Requirements

Built artifacts should be in ./dockerfiles/run/spring/destination folder for Spring.
If you haven't already:

    $ docker build -t james/project dockerfiles/compilation/java-8
    $ docker run -v $HOME/.m2:/root/.m2 -v $PWD:/origin \
  -v $PWD/dockerfiles/run/spring/destination:/spring/destination \
  -t james/project -s HEAD


===== Howto ?

We need to provide the key we will use for TLS. For obvious reasons, this is not provided in this git.

Copy your TSL keys to destination/run/spring/conf/keystore or generate it using the following command. The password must be james72laBalle to match default configuration.

    $ keytool -genkey -alias james -keyalg RSA -keystore dockerfiles/run/spring/destination/conf/keystore

Then we need to build james container :

    $ docker build -t james_run dockerfiles/run/spring/

The provisioned james images bases on pre-build james server which is "linagora/james-project-spring-jpa". If we need to build james container with the default initial data (initial domain: james.local and initial users: user01, user02, user03):

    $ docker build -t james_run dockerfiles/run/spring/provisioned/

To run this container :

    $ docker run --hostname HOSTNAME -p "25:25" -p "110:110" -p "143:143" -p "465:465" -p "587:587" -p "993:993" --name james_run -t james_run

Where HOSTNAME is the hostname you want to give to your James container. This DNS entry will be used to send mail to your James server.


=== Other Useful commands

The base command is different whether you choose guice flavor or spring :

  * guice use : `docker exec james_run java -jar /root/james-cli.jar`
  * spring use : `docker exec james_run /root/james-server-app-3.0.0-beta6-SNAPSHOT/bin/james-cli.sh`

==== How to add a domain ?

    # Add DOMAIN to 127.0.0.1 in your host /etc/hosts
    $ <your-command-here> -h 127.0.0.1 -p 9999 adddomain DOMAIN

DOMAIN: is the domain you want to add.

Note: Using docker, one can add an environment variable holding the domain to be created. This
domain will be created upon James start:

    $ --environment DOMAIN=domain.tld

==== How to add a user ?

    $ <your-command-here> -h 127.0.0.1 -p 9999 adduser USER_MAIL_ADDRESS PASSWORD

Where :

* USER_MAIL_ADDRESS: is the mail address that will be used by this user.
* PASSWORD: is the password that will be used by this user.

You can then just add DOMAIN to your /etc/hosts and you can connect to your james account with for instance Thunderbird.

==== How to manage SIEVE scripts ?

Each user can manage his SIEVE scripts threw the manage SIEVE mailet.

To use the manage SIEVE mailet :

 * You need to create the user sievemanager@DOMAIN ( if you don't, the SMTP server will check the domain, recognize it, and look for an absent local user, and will generate an error ).
 * You can send Manage Sieve commands by mail to sievemanager@DOMAIN. Your subject must contain the command. Scripts needs to be added as attachments and need the ".sieve" extension.

To activate a script for a user, you need the following combinaison :

 * PUTSCRIPT scriptname
 * SETACTIVE scriptname

==== How to retrieve users and password from my previous container

Some james data (those non related to mailbox, eg : mail queue, domains, users, rrt, SIEVE scripts, mail repositories ) are not yet supported by our Cassandra implementation.

To keep these data when you run a new container, you can mount the following volume :

 -v /root/james-server-app-3.0.0-beta6-SNAPSHOT/var:WORKDIR/destination/var

Where :

* WORKDIR: is the absolute path to your james-parent workdir.

Beware : you will have concurrency issues if multiple containers are running on this single volume.

==== How to run deployment Tests

We wrote some MPT (James' Mail Protocols Tests subproject) deployment tests to validate a James
deployment.

It uses the External-James module, that uses environment variables to locate a remote
IMAP server and run integration tests against it.

For that, the target James Server needs to be configured with a domain domain and a user imapuser
with password password. Read above documentation to see how you can do this.

You have to run MPT tests inside docker. As you need to use maven, the simplest option is to
use james/parent image, and override the entry point ( as git and maven are already configured
there ) :

    $ docker run -t --entrypoint="/root/integration_tests.sh" -v $PWD/.m2:/root/.m2 -v $PWD:/origin james/project JAMES_IP JAMES_PORT SHA1

Where :

* JAMES_IP: IP address or DNS entry for your James server
* JAMES_PORT: Port allocated to James' IMAP port (should be 143).
* SHA1(optional): Branch to use in order to build integration tests or master if none.

==== How to check the merge of a commit

First step, you have to build the Docker image

    $ docker build -t james/merge dockerfiles/merge

In order to run the build, you have to launch the following command:

    $ docker run -v $PWD:/origin -t james/merge SHA1 RESULTING_BRANCH

Where :

- SHA1: is the given git SHA1 of the james-project repository to merge.
- RESULTING_BRANCH: is the branch created when merging.

=== Generating a debian package for James

You can generate a debian package for James by using the following process.

First step, you have to build the Docker image used to generate the package

    $ docker build -t build-james-deb --build-arg RELEASE=3.0-beta6 --build-arg ITERATION=1 dockerfiles/packaging/debian/

Where:

- ITERATION is the release number used after the last hyphen (e.g. 3.0-beta6-1, 3.0-beta6-2, 3.0-beta6-3...)

Then, you have to run the container:

    $ docker run --name james-deb -v $PWD/jars:/jars -v $PWD/result:/result build-james-deb

Where:

- $PWD/jars is the path to the folder containing the maven result (main jar and lib folder)
- $PWD/result is the folder where the debian package will be copied

The https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_email[history of email] has resulted
in a convoluted patchwork of standards and practices, which can be very difficult

consistent and comprehensible way.

To help you understand how James approaches emails, we have divided this section
up into the following parts:

 * xref:messages/index.adoc[]
 * xref:protocols/index.adoc[]

= James User Model
:navtitle: User Model


For clarity, we have defined various roles for actors who interact 
with xref:servers/index.adoc[James servers] in one way or another.
The deliverables we make available are produced with these roles in mind.
Note that any given person may play more than one role, even at the same
time.

 * <<User>>
 * <<Operator>>
 * <<Integrator>>
 * <<Developer>>
 * <<Contributor>>
 * <<Committer>>
 * <<PMC Member>>

== User

A **User** simply uses email without any notion of what server is providing the service.

More precisely, in typical cases a User will have an email client for reading and writing email. The
xref:glossary.adoc[email client] will connect to the James server via 
xref:mail/protocols/smtp.adoc[SMTP], 
xref:mail/protocols/pop.adoc[POP], or 
xref:mail/protocols/imap.adoc[IMAP].
The User will have no indication anywhere that the server is a James server.


== Operator

An **Operator** installs and runs James for the benefit of Users.

The Operator does not compile any Java code, and does not require any software
development environment. 

Apache James offers Operators a range of servers for various use cases, including:

 * A xref:server/basic/index.adoc[Basic Server] ideal for busy Operators who 
   are interested in an easy-to-use self-hosting solution, but who may not have the
   time to gain deep expertise
 * An xref:server/advanced/index.adoc[Advanced Server] well-suited for Operators with
   advanced skills and resources who are not daunted by getting their hands dirty
   with configurations or using built-in extensions



== Integrator 

An **Integrator** has some expertise with Java or a JVM-based language. Based 
on this expertise the Integrator can perform more advanced server configurations and may
develop xref:xxx.adoc[Extensions] to customize the behavior of a James server.

An Integrator does **not** need to download the source code or compile James.



== Developer

A **Developer** uses the James codebase, executes a build using the provided
build system (Maven), may edit the source code and deploy the built artifacts.



== Contributor

A **Contributor** refers to anyone involved with the Apache James community by:

 * Filing an issue on the https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/Dashboard.jspa[issue tracking system]
 * Posting a question on the https://james.apache.org/mail.html[mailing list] 
   or on the https://gitter.im/apache/james-project[gitter channel]
 * Submitting a https://github.com/apache/james-project/pulls[pull request] (PR)
 * Fixes, refines and writes documentation
 * Writes a tutorial or article about James
 * Otherwise generally helps the James Community in any other way not listed here



== Committer

A **Committer** is granted special rights (according to 
https://www.apache.org/dev/committers.html[Apache practices]) 
to participate in the development of James by:

 * Accepting (being assigned) issues in the https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/Dashboard.jspa[issue tracking system]
 * Merging code into the https://github.com/apache/james-project[git repository]
 * Being granted a voice when voting matters arise


== PMC Member

A **PMC** (Project Management Committee) Member
is a Committer who is also a member of the PMC, as stipulated by 
https://www.apache.org/dev/pmc.html[Apache rules].

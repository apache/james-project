= Apache James Domain Model
:navtitle: Domain Model

Apache James uses the xref:architecture/index.adoc[hexagonal architecture] to 
distinguish the xref:dev:domain/core/index.adoc[core elements] of its domain 
from xref:dev:domain/external/index.adoc[everything else]. This section
describes the core domain model in some detail, and how the core components
interact with external components.

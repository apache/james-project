= Logging in Apache James

NOTE: This information targets developers.

Logging is very important when running a software.
Most of the time people use logs for debugging and troubleshooting issues in production.
In Apache James we leverage a logging facade for logging http://www.slf4j.org/[Slf4j] .
Please see the documentation for exact details.

In a typical application logs are stored for a specific period.
This can be 1 day, 1 week, etc.

Some other typical scenarios include:

* Rotating logs periodically.
* Shipping logs centrally.
* Saving some logging messages to other files / end devices

By leveraging a logging facade like Slf4j, the end user has the ability to use different logging back ends and achieve the above requirements.

Logging is something we do to help the people running our code.
We also help ourselves when they encounter bugs, and they need to share information with us for a fix.
As developers, we should be mindful of the logging statements.
We should also be mindful about the performance implications of logging and not abuse it.

== Loggers used in code

You can define a logger using a string or a class.
For common loggers it's ok to use a string name.

[source,java]
--
    private static final Logger LOGGER = LoggerFactory.getLogger("org.apache.james.CONFIGURATION");
    private static final Logger LOGGER = LoggerFactory.getLogger(JamesServerMain.class);
--

Loggers can be hierarchical.
This helps when we build a logger from a class name, and we use package structure to drive the logger hierarchy.

The most useful loggers should to be documented below.
Please maintain this list of loggers.

org.apache.james.CONFIGURATION:: It is used to log events related to configuration loading and updating.

== Logging when debugging tests

When investigating failing tests, increasing the log level can provide valuable insights.

=== Log Configuration

All modules in James inherit their default test log configurations from the `testing-base` module.
The log settings are defined in link:https://github.com/apache/james-project/blob/master/testing/base/src/main/resources/logback-test.xml[resources/logback-test.xml].

=== Activating Debug Logs

To enable debug logs, refer to the instructions in the header of `link:https://github.com/apache/james-project/blob/master/testing/base/src/main/resources/logback-test.xml[resources/logback-test.xml]`.
Carefully follow the steps mentioned to adjust the log level appropriately.

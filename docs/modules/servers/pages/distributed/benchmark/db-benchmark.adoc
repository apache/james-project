=== Benchmark Cassandra

==== Benchmark methodology
===== Benchmark tool

We use https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/cassandra/tools/cassandra_stress.html[cassandra-stress tool] - an official
tool of Cassandra for stress loading tests.

The cassandra-stress tool is a Java-based stress testing utility for basic benchmarking and load testing a Cassandra cluster.
Data modeling choices can greatly affect application performance. Significant load testing over several trials is the best method for discovering issues with a particular data model. The cassandra-stress tool is an effective tool for populating a cluster and stress testing CQL tables and queries. Use cassandra-stress to:

- Quickly determine how a schema performs.
- Understand how your database scales.
- Optimize your data model and settings.
- Determine production capacity.

There are several operation types:

- write-only, read-only, and mixed workloads of standard data
- write-only and read-only workloads for counter columns
- user configured workloads, running custom queries on custom schemas

===== How to benchmark

Here we are using a simple case to test and compare Cassandra performance between different setup environments.

[source,yaml]
----
keyspace: stresscql

keyspace_definition: |
  CREATE KEYSPACE stresscql WITH replication = {'class': 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor': 3};

table: mixed_workload

table_definition: |
  CREATE TABLE mixed_workload (
    key uuid PRIMARY KEY,
    a blob,
    b blob
  ) WITH COMPACT STORAGE

columnspec:
  - name: a
    size: uniform(1..10000)
  - name: b
    size: uniform(1..100000)

insert:
  partitions: fixed(1)

queries:
   read:
      cql: select * from mixed_workload where key = ?
      fields: samerow
----

Create the yaml file as above and copy to a Cassandra node.

Insert some sample data:

[source,bash]
----
cassandra-stress user profile=mixed_workload.yml n=100000 "ops(insert=1)" cl=ONE -mode native cql3 user=<user> password=<password> -node <IP> -rate threads=8 -graph file=./graph_insert.xml title=Benchmark revision=insert_ONE
----

Read intensive scenario:

[source,bash]
----
cassandra-stress user profile=mixed_workload.yml n=100000 "ops(insert=1,read=4)" cl=ONE -mode native cql3 user=<user> password=<password> -node <IP> -rate threads=8 -graph file=./graph_mixed.xml title=Benchmark revision=mixed_ONE
----

In there:

- n=100000: The number of insert batches, not number of individual insert operations.
- rate threads=8: The number of concurrent threads. If not specified it will start with 4 threads and increase until server reaches a limit.
- ops(insert=1,read=4): This will execute insert and read queries in the ratio 1:4.
- graph: Export results to graph in html format.

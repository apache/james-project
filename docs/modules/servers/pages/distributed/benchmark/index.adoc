:navtitle: Performance testing the Distributed server

The following pages detail how to do performance testing for the Distributed server also its database.

Once you have a Distributed James server up and running you then need to ensure it operates correctly and has a decent performance.
You may need to do performance testings periodically to make sure your James performs well.

We introduced xref:distributed/benchmark/james-benchmark.adoc[tools and base benchmark result for Distributed James] also xref:distributed/benchmark/db-benchmark.adoc[James database's base performance and how to benchmark them]
to cover this topic.

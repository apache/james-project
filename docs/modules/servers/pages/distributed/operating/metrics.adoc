= Metrics

(TODO migrate and adapt content from
https://github.com/linagora/james-project/blob/master/src/site/xdoc/server/metrics.xml)

If some metrics seem abnormally slow despite in depth database
performance tuning, feedback is appreciated as well on the bug tracker,
the user mailing list or our Gitter channel (see our
http://james.apache.org/#second[community page]) . Any additional
details categorizing the slowness are appreciated as well (details of
the slow requests for instance).

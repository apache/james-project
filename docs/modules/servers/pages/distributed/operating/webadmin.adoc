= WebAdmin REST administration API

The web administration supports for now the CRUD operations on the domains, the users, their mailboxes and their quotas,
 managing mail repositories, performing cassandra migrations, and much more, as described in the following sections.

*WARNING*: This API allow authentication only via the use of JWT. If not
configured with JWT, an administrator should ensure an attacker can not
use this API.

By the way, some endpoints are not filtered by authentication. Those endpoints are not related to data stored in James,
for example: Swagger documentation & James health checks.

In case of any error, the system will return an error message which is
json format like this:

....
{
    statusCode: <error_code>,
    type: <error_type>,
    message: <the_error_message>
    cause: <the_detail_message_from_throwable>
}
....

Also be aware that, in case things go wrong, all endpoints might return
a 500 internal error (with a JSON body formatted as exposed above). To
avoid information duplication, this is omitted on endpoint specific
documentation.

Finally, please note that in case of a malformed URL the 400 bad request
response will contain an HTML body.

== HealthCheck

=== Check all components

This endpoint is simple for now and is just returning the http status
code corresponding to the state of checks (see below). The user has to
check in the logs in order to have more information about failing
checks.

....
curl -XGET http://ip:port/healthcheck
....

Will return a list of healthChecks execution result, with an aggregated
result:

....
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "checks": [
    {
      "componentName": "Cassandra backend",
      "escapedComponentName": "Cassandra%20backend",
      "status": "healthy"
      "cause": null
    }
  ]
}
....

*status* field can be:

* *healthy*: Component works normally
* *degraded*: Component works in degraded mode. Some non-critical
services may not be working, or latencies are high, for example. Cause
contains explanations.
* *unhealthy*: The component is currently not working. Cause contains
explanations.

Supported health checks include:

* *Cassandra backend*: Cassandra storage.
* *ElasticSearch Backend*: ElasticSearch storage.
* *EventDeadLettersHealthCheck*
* *Guice application lifecycle*
* *JPA Backend*: JPA storage.
* *MessageFastViewProjection* Health check of the component storing JMAP properties
which are fast to retrieve. Those properties are computed in advance
from messages and persisted in order to archive a better performance.
There are some latencies between a source update and its projections
updates. Incoherency problems arise when reads are performed in this
time-window. We piggyback the projection update on missed JMAP read in
order to decrease the outdated time window for a given entry. The health
is determined by the ratio of missed projection reads. (lower than 10%
causes `degraded`)
* *RabbitMQ backend*: RabbitMQ messaging.

Response codes:

* 200: All checks have answered with a Healthy or Degraded status. James
services can still be used.
* 503: At least one check have answered with a Unhealthy status

=== Check single component

Performs a health check for the given component. The component is
referenced by its URL encoded name.

....
curl -XGET http://ip:port/healthcheck/checks/Cassandra%20backend
....

Will return the component’s name, the component’s escaped name, the
health status and a cause.

....
{
  "componentName": "Cassandra backend",
  "escapedComponentName": "Cassandra%20backend",
  "status": "healthy"
  "cause": null
}
....

Response codes:

* 200: The check has answered with a Healthy or Degraded status.
* 404: A component with the given name was not found.
* 503: The check has anwered with a Unhealthy status.

=== List all health checks

This endpoint lists all the available health checks.

....
curl -XGET http://ip:port/healthcheck/checks
....

Will return the list of all available health checks.

....
[
    {
        "componentName": "Cassandra backend",
        "escapedComponentName": "Cassandra%20backend"
    }
]
....

Response codes:

* 200: List of available health checks

== Administrating domains

=== Create a domain

....
curl -XPUT http://ip:port/domains/domainToBeCreated
....

* can not be null or empty
* can not contain `@'
* can not be more than 255 characters
* can not contain `/'

Response codes:

* 204: The domain was successfully added
* 400: The domain name is invalid

=== Delete a domain

....
curl -XDELETE http://ip:port/domains/{domainToBeDeleted}
....

Note: Deletion of an auto-detected domain, default domain or of an
auto-detected ip is not supported. We encourage you instead to review
your https://james.apache.org/server/config-domainlist.html[domain list
configuration].

Response codes:

* 204: The domain was successfully removed

=== Test if a domain exists

....
curl -XGET http://ip:port/domains/{domainName}
....

Response codes:

* 204: The domain exists
* 404: The domain does not exist

=== Get the list of domains

....
curl -XGET http://ip:port/domains
....

Possible response:

....
["domain1", "domain2"]
....

Response codes:

* 200: The domain list was successfully retrieved

=== Get the list of aliases for a domain

....
curl -XGET http://ip:port/domains/destination.domain.tld/aliases
....

Possible response:

....
[
  {"source": "source1.domain.tld"},
  {"source": "source2.domain.tld"}
]
....

When sending an email to an email address having `source1.domain.tld` or
`source2.domain.tld` as a domain part (example:
`user@source1.domain.tld`), then the domain part will be rewritten into
destination.domain.tld (so into `user@destination.domain.tld`).

Response codes:

* 200: The domain aliases was successfully retrieved
* 400: destination.domain.tld has an invalid syntax
* 404: destination.domain.tld is not part of handled domains and does
not have local domains as aliases.

=== Create an alias for a domain

To create a domain alias execute the following query:

....
curl -XPUT http://ip:port/domains/destination.domain.tld/aliases/source.domain.tld
....

When sending an email to an email address having `source.domain.tld` as
a domain part (example: `user@source.domain.tld`), then the domain part
will be rewritten into `destination.domain.tld` (so into
`user@destination.domain.tld`).

Response codes:

* 204: The redirection now exists
* 400: `source.domain.tld` or `destination.domain.tld` have an invalid
syntax
* 400: `source, domain` and `destination domain` are the same
* 404: `source.domain.tld` are not part of handled domains.

=== Delete an alias for a domain

To delete a domain alias execute the following query:

....
curl -XDELETE http://ip:port/domains/destination.domain.tld/aliases/source.domain.tld
....

When sending an email to an email address having `source.domain.tld` as
a domain part (example: `user@source.domain.tld`), then the domain part
will be rewritten into `destination.domain.tld` (so into
`user@destination.domain.tld`).

Response codes:

* 204: The redirection now no longer exists
* 400: `source.domain.tld` or destination.domain.tld have an invalid
syntax
* 400: source, domain and destination domain are the same
* 404: `source.domain.tld` are not part of handled domains.

== Administrating users

=== Create a user

....
curl -XPUT http://ip:port/users/usernameToBeUsed \
  -d '{"password":"passwordToBeUsed"}' \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
....

Resource name usernameToBeUsed representing valid users, hence it should
match the criteria at (TODO) link:/server/config-users.html[User Repositories
documentation]

Response codes:

* 204: The user was successfully created
* 400: The user name or the payload is invalid

Note: if the user exists already, its password will be updated.

=== Testing a user existence

....
curl -XHEAD http://ip:port/users/usernameToBeUsed
....

Resource name ``usernameToBeUsed'' represents a valid user, hence it
should match the criteria at (TODO) link:/server/config-users.html[User
Repositories documentation]

Response codes:

* 200: The user exists
* 400: The user name is invalid
* 404: The user does not exist

=== Updating a user password

Same than Create, but a user need to exist.

If the user do not exist, then it will be created.

=== Deleting a user

....
curl -XDELETE http://ip:port/users/{userToBeDeleted}
....

Response codes:

* 204: The user was successfully deleted

=== Retrieving the user list

....
curl -XGET http://ip:port/users
....

The answer looks like:

....
[{"username":"username@domain-jmapauthentication.tld"},{"username":"username@domain.tld"}]
....

Response codes:

* 200: The user name list was successfully retrieved

=== Retrieving the list of allowed `From` headers for a given user

This endpoint allows to know which From headers a given user is allowed to use when sending mails.

....
curl -XGET http://ip:port/users/givenUser/allowedFromHeaders
....

The answer looks like:

....
["user@domain.tld","alias@domain.tld"]
....

Response codes:

* 200: The list was successfully retrieved
* 400: The user is invalid
* 404: The user is unknown

== Administrating mailboxes

=== All mailboxes

Several actions can be performed on the server mailboxes.

Request pattern is:

....
curl -XPOST /mailboxes?action={action1},...
....

link:#_endpoints_returning_a_task[More details about endpoints returning
a task].

Response codes:

* 201: Success. Corresponding task id is returned.
* 400: Error in the request. Details can be found in the reported error.

The kind of task scheduled depends on the action parameter. See below
for details.

==== Fixing mailboxes inconsistencies

....
curl -XPOST /mailboxes?task=SolveInconsistencies
....

Will schedule a task for fixing inconsistencies for the mailbox
deduplicated object stored in Cassandra.

link:#_endpoints_returning_a_task[More details about endpoints returning
a task].

The `I-KNOW-WHAT-I-M-DOING` header is mandatory (you can read more
information about it in the warning section below).

The scheduled task will have the following type
`solve-mailbox-inconsistencies` and the following
`additionalInformation`:

....
{
  "type":"solve-mailbox-inconsistencies",
  "processedMailboxEntries": 3,
  "processedMailboxPathEntries": 3,
  "fixedInconsistencies": 2,
  "errors": 1,
  "conflictingEntries":[{
    "mailboxDaoEntry":{
      "mailboxPath":"#private:user:mailboxName",
      "mailboxId":"464765a0-e4e7-11e4-aba4-710c1de3782b"
    }," +
    "mailboxPathDaoEntry":{
      "mailboxPath":"#private:user:mailboxName2",
      "mailboxId":"464765a0-e4e7-11e4-aba4-710c1de3782b"
    }
  }]
}
....

Note that conflicting entry inconsistencies will not be fixed and will
require to explicitly use link:#correcting-ghost-mailbox[ghost mailbox]
endpoint in order to merge the conflicting mailboxes and prevent any
message loss.

*WARNING*: this task can cancel concurrently running legitimate user
operations upon dirty read. As such this task should be run offline.

A dirty read is when data is read between the two writes of the
denormalization operations (no isolation).

In order to ensure being offline, stop the traffic on SMTP, JMAP and
IMAP ports, for example via re-configuration or firewall rules.

Due to all of those risks, a `I-KNOW-WHAT-I-M-DOING` header should be
positioned to `ALL-SERVICES-ARE-OFFLINE` in order to prevent accidental
calls.

==== Recomputing mailbox counters

....
curl -XPOST /mailboxes?task=RecomputeMailboxCounters
....

Will recompute counters (unseen & total count) for the mailbox object
stored in Cassandra.

Cassandra maintains a per mailbox projection for message count and
unseen message count. As with any projection, it can go out of sync,
leading to inconsistent results being returned to the client.

link:#_endpoints_returning_a_task[More details about endpoints returning
a task].

The scheduled task will have the following type
`recompute-mailbox-counters` and the following `additionalInformation`:

....
{
  "type":"recompute-mailbox-counters",
  "processedMailboxes": 3,
  "failedMailboxes": ["464765a0-e4e7-11e4-aba4-710c1de3782b"]
}
....

Note that conflicting inconsistencies entries will not be fixed and will
require to explicitly use link:#correcting-ghost-mailbox[ghost mailbox]
endpoint in order to merge the conflicting mailboxes and prevent any
message loss.

*WARNING*: this task do not take into account concurrent modifications
upon a single mailbox counter recomputation. Rerunning the task will
_eventually_ provide the consistent result. As such we advise to run
this task offline.

In order to ensure being offline, stop the traffic on SMTP, JMAP and
IMAP ports, for example via re-configuration or firewall rules.

`trustMessageProjection` query parameter can be set to `true`. Content
of `messageIdTable` (listing messages by their mailbox context) table
will be trusted and not compared against content of `imapUidTable` table
(listing messages by their messageId mailbox independent identifier).
This will result in a better performance running the task at the cost of
safety in the face of message denormalization inconsistencies.

Defaults to false, which generates additional checks. You can read
https://github.com/apache/james-project/blob/master/src/adr/0022-cassandra-message-inconsistency.md[this
ADR] to better understand the message projection and how it can become
inconsistent.

==== Recomputing Global JMAP fast message view projection

Message fast view projection stores message properties expected to be
fast to fetch but are actually expensive to compute, in order for
GetMessages operation to be fast to execute for these properties.

These projection items are asynchronously computed on mailbox events.

You can force the full projection recomputation by calling the following
endpoint:

....
curl -XPOST /mailboxes?task=recomputeFastViewProjectionItems
....

Will schedule a task for recomputing the fast message view projection
for all mailboxes.

link:#_endpoints_returning_a_task[More details about endpoints returning
a task].

An admin can specify the concurrency that should be used when running
the task:

* `messagesPerSecond` rate at which messages should be processed, per
second. Defaults to 10.

This optional parameter must have a strictly positive integer as a value
and be passed as query parameters.

Example:

....
curl -XPOST /mailboxes?task=recomputeFastViewProjectionItems&messagesPerSecond=20
....

The scheduled task will have the following type
`RecomputeAllFastViewProjectionItemsTask` and the following
`additionalInformation`:

....
{
  "type":"RecomputeAllPreviewsTask",
  "processedUserCount": 3,
  "processedMessageCount": 3,
  "failedUserCount": 2,
  "failedMessageCount": 1,
  "runningOptions": {
    "messagesPerSecond":20
  }
}
....

Response codes:

* 201: Success. Corresponding task id is returned.
* 400: Error in the request. Details can be found in the reported error.

==== ReIndexing action

Be also aware of the limits of this API:

Warning: During the re-indexing, the result of search operations might
be altered.

Warning: Canceling this task should be considered unsafe as it will
leave the currently reIndexed mailbox as partially indexed.

Warning: While we have been trying to reduce the inconsistency window to
a maximum (by keeping track of ongoing events), concurrent changes done
during the reIndexing might be ignored.

===== ReIndexing all mails

....
curl -XPOST http://ip:port/mailboxes?task=reIndex
....

Will schedule a task for reIndexing all the mails stored on this James
server.

link:#_endpoints_returning_a_task[More details about endpoints returning
a task].

An admin can specify the concurrency that should be used when running
the task:

* `messagesPerSecond` rate at which messages should be processed per
second. Default is 50.

This optional parameter must have a strictly positive integer as a value
and be passed as query parameter.

An admin can also specify the reindexing mode it wants to use when
running the task:

* `mode` the reindexing mode used. There are 2 modes for the moment:
** `rebuildAll` allows to rebuild all indexes. This is the default mode.
** `fixOutdated` will check for outdated indexed document and reindex
only those.

This optional parameter must be passed as query parameter.

It’s good to note as well that there is a limitation with the
`fixOutdated` mode. As we first collect metadata of stored messages to
compare them with the ones in the index, a failed `expunged` operation
might not be well corrected (as the message might not exist anymore but
still be indexed).

Example:

    curl -XPOST http://ip:port/mailboxes?task=reIndex&messagesPerSecond=200&mode=rebuildAll

The scheduled task will have the following type `full-reindexing` and
the following `additionalInformation`:

....
{
  "type":"full-reindexing",
  "runningOptions":{
    "messagesPerSecond":200,
    "mode":"REBUILD_ALL"
  },
  "successfullyReprocessedMailCount":18,
  "failedReprocessedMailCount": 3,
  "mailboxFailures": ["12", "23" ],
  "messageFailures": [
   {
     "mailboxId": "1",
      "uids": [1, 36]
   }]
}
....

===== Fixing previously failed ReIndexing

Will schedule a task for reIndexing all the mails which had failed to be
indexed from the ReIndexingAllMails task.

Given `bbdb69c9-082a-44b0-a85a-6e33e74287a5` being a `taskId` generated
for a reIndexing tasks

....
curl -XPOST 'http://ip:port/mailboxes?task=reIndex&reIndexFailedMessagesOf=bbdb69c9-082a-44b0-a85a-6e33e74287a5'
....

link:#_endpoints_returning_a_task[More details about endpoints returning

....

The scheduled task will have the following type
`error-recovery-indexation` and the following `additionalInformation`:

....
{
  "type":"error-recovery-indexation"
  "runningOptions":{
    "messagesPerSecond":200,
    "mode":"REBUILD_ALL"

  "mailboxFailures": ["12", "23" ],
  "messageFailures": [{
     "mailboxId": "1",
      "uids": [1, 36]
   }]
}
....

== Single mailbox

=== ReIndexing a mailbox mails

....
curl -XPOST http://ip:port/mailboxes/{mailboxId}?task=reIndex
....

Will schedule a task for reIndexing all the mails in one mailbox.

Note that `mailboxId' path parameter needs to be a (implementation
dependent) valid mailboxId.

link:#_endpoints_returning_a_task[More details about endpoints returning
a task].

An admin can specify the concurrency that should be used when running
the task:

* `messagesPerSecond` rate at which messages should be processed per
second. Default is 50.

This optional parameter must have a strictly positive integer as a value
and be passed as query parameter.

....

Response codes:

* 201: Success. Corresponding task id is returned.
* 400: Error in the request. Details can be found in the reported error.

The scheduled task will have the following type `mailbox-reindexing` and
the following `additionalInformation`:

....
{
  "type":"mailbox-reindexing",
  "runningOptions":{
    "messagesPerSecond":200,
    "mode":"FIX_OUTDATED"

   {
     "mailboxId": "1",
      "uids": [1, 36]
   }]
}
....

Warning: During the re-indexing, the result of search operations might
be altered.

Warning: Canceling this task should be considered unsafe as it will
leave the currently reIndexed mailbox as partially indexed.

Warning: While we have been trying to reduce the inconsistency window to
a maximum (by keeping track of ongoing events), concurrent changes done
during the reIndexing might be ignored.

== Administrating Messages

=== ReIndexing a single mail by messageId

....
curl -XPOST http://ip:port/messages/{messageId}?task=reIndex
....

Will schedule a task for reIndexing a single email in all the mailboxes
containing it.

Note that `messageId' path parameter needs to be a (implementation
dependent) valid messageId.

link:#_endpoints_returning_a_task[More details about endpoints returning
a task].

Response codes:

* 201: Success. Corresponding task id is returned.

The scheduled task will have the following type `messageId-reindexing`
and the following `additionalInformation`:

....
{
  "messageId":"18"
}
....

Warning: During the re-indexing, the result of search operations might
be altered.

=== Fixing message inconsistencies

This task is only available on top of Guice Cassandra products.

....
curl -XPOST /messages?task=SolveInconsistencies
....

Will schedule a task for fixing message inconsistencies created by the
message denormalization process.

Messages are denormalized and stored in separated data tables in
Cassandra, so they can be accessed by their unique identifier or mailbox
identifier & local mailbox identifier through different protocols.

Failure in the denormalization process will lead to inconsistencies, for
example:

....
BOB receives a message
The denormalization process fails
BOB can read the message via JMAP
BOB cannot read the message via IMAP

BOB marks a message as SEEN
The denormalization process fails
The message is SEEN via JMAP
The message is UNSEEN via IMAP
....

link:#_endpoints_returning_a_task[More details about endpoints returning
a task].

An admin can specify the concurrency that should be used when running
the task:

* `messagesPerSecond` rate of messages to be processed per second.
Default is 100.

This optional parameter must have a strictly positive integer as a value
and be passed as query parameter.

An admin can also specify the reindexing mode it wants to use when
running the task:

* `mode` the reindexing mode used. There are 2 modes for the moment:
** `rebuildAll` allows to rebuild all indexes. This is the default mode.
** `fixOutdated` will check for outdated indexed document and reindex
only those.

This optional parameter must be passed as query parameter.

It’s good to note as well that there is a limitation with the
`fixOutdated` mode. As we first collect metadata of stored messages to
compare them with the ones in the index, a failed `expunged` operation
might not be well corrected (as the message might not exist anymore but
still be indexed).

Example:

....
curl -XPOST /messages?task=SolveInconsistencies&messagesPerSecond=200&mode=rebuildAll
....

Response codes:

* 201: Success. Corresponding task id is returned.
* 400: Error in the request. Details can be found in the reported error.

The scheduled task will have the following type
`solve-message-inconsistencies` and the following
`additionalInformation`:

....
{
  "type":"solve-message-inconsistencies",
  "timestamp":"2007-12-03T10:15:30Z",
  "processedImapUidEntries": 2,
  "processedMessageIdEntries": 1,

    }
  ],
  "errors": [
    {
      "mailboxId": "551f0580-82fb-11ea-970e-f9c83d4cf8c2",
      "messageId": "ffffffff-7e63-11ea-883c-95b84008f979",
      "uid": 3
    }
  ]
}
....

User actions concurrent to the inconsistency fixing task could result in
concurrency issues. New inconsistencies could be created.

However the source of truth will not be impacted, hence rerunning the
task will eventually fix all issues.

This task could be run safely online and can be scheduled on a recurring
basis outside of peak traffic by an admin to ensure Cassandra message
consistency.

== Administrating user mailboxes

=== Creating a mailbox

....
curl -XPUT http://ip:port/users/{usernameToBeUsed}/mailboxes/{mailboxNameToBeCreated}
....

Resource name `usernameToBeUsed` should be an existing user Resource
name `mailboxNameToBeCreated` should not be empty, nor contain # & % *
characters.

Response codes:

* 204: The mailbox now exists on the server
* 400: Invalid mailbox name
* 404: The user name does not exist

To create nested mailboxes, for instance a work mailbox inside the INBOX
mailbox, people should use the . separator. The sample query is:

....
curl -XDELETE http://ip:port/users/{usernameToBeUsed}/mailboxes/INBOX.work
....

=== Deleting a mailbox and its children

....
curl -XDELETE http://ip:port/users/{usernameToBeUsed}/mailboxes/{mailboxNameToBeDeleted}
....

Resource name `usernameToBeUsed` should be an existing user Resource
name `mailboxNameToBeDeleted` should not be empty

Response codes:

* 204: The mailbox now does not exist on the server
* 400: Invalid mailbox name
* 404: The user name does not exist

=== Testing existence of a mailbox

....
curl -XGET http://ip:port/users/{usernameToBeUsed}/mailboxes/{mailboxNameToBeTested}
....

Resource name `usernameToBeUsed` should be an existing user Resource
name `mailboxNameToBeTested` should not be empty

Response codes:

* 204: The mailbox exists
* 400: Invalid mailbox name
* 404: The user name does not exist, the mailbox does not exist

=== Listing user mailboxes

....
curl -XGET http://ip:port/users/{usernameToBeUsed}/mailboxes
....

The answer looks like:

....
[{"mailboxName":"INBOX"},{"mailboxName":"outbox"}]
....

Resource name `usernameToBeUsed` should be an existing user

Response codes:

* 200: The mailboxes list was successfully retrieved
* 404: The user name does not exist

=== Deleting user mailboxes

....
curl -XDELETE http://ip:port/users/{usernameToBeUsed}/mailboxes
....

Resource name `usernameToBeUsed` should be an existing user

Response codes:

* 204: The user do not have mailboxes anymore
* 404: The user name does not exist

=== Exporting user mailboxes

....
curl -XPOST http://ip:port/users/{usernameToBeUsed}/mailboxes?action=export
....

Resource name `usernameToBeUsed` should be an existing user

Response codes:

* 201: Success. Corresponding task id is returned
* 404: The user name does not exist

The scheduled task will have the following type `MailboxesExportTask`
and the following `additionalInformation`:

....
{
  "type":"MailboxesExportTask",
  "timestamp":"2007-12-03T10:15:30Z",
  "username": "user",
  "stage": "STARTING"
}
....

=== ReIndexing a user mails

....
curl -XPOST http://ip:port/users/{usernameToBeUsed}/mailboxes?task=reIndex
....

Will schedule a task for reIndexing all the mails in ``user@domain.com''
mailboxes (encoded above).

link:#_endpoints_returning_a_task[More details about endpoints returning
a task].

An admin can specify the concurrency that should be used when running
the task:

* `messagesPerSecond` rate at which messages should be processed per
second. Default is 50.

This optional parameter must have a strictly positive integer as a value
and be passed as query parameter.

An admin can also specify the reindexing mode it wants to use when
running the task:

* `mode` the reindexing mode used. There are 2 modes for the moment:
** `rebuildAll` allows to rebuild all indexes. This is the default mode.
** `fixOutdated` will check for outdated indexed document and reindex
only those.

This optional parameter must be passed as query parameter.

It’s good to note as well that there is a limitation with the
`fixOutdated` mode. As we first collect metadata of stored messages to
compare them with the ones in the index, a failed `expunged` operation
might not be well corrected (as the message might not exist anymore but
still be indexed).

Example:

....
curl -XPOST http://ip:port/users/{usernameToBeUsed}/mailboxes?task=reIndex&messagesPerSecond=200&mode=fixOutdated
....

Response codes:

* 201: Success. Corresponding task id is returned.
* 400: Error in the request. Details can be found in the reported error.

The scheduled task will have the following type `user-reindexing` and
the following `additionalInformation`:

....
{
  "type":"user-reindexing",
  "runningOptions":{
    "messagesPerSecond":200,
    "mode":"FIX_OUTDATED"
  },
  "user":"user@domain.com",
  "successfullyReprocessedMailCount":18,
  "failedReprocessedMailCount": 3,
  "mailboxFailures": ["12", "23" ],
  "messageFailures": [
   {
     "mailboxId": "1",
      "uids": [1, 36]
   }]
}
....

Warning: During the re-indexing, the result of search operations might
be altered.

Warning: Canceling this task should be considered unsafe as it will
leave the currently reIndexed mailbox as partially indexed.

Warning: While we have been trying to reduce the inconsistency window to
a maximum (by keeping track of ongoing events), concurrent changes done
during the reIndexing might be ignored.

=== Recomputing User JMAP fast message view projection

This action is only available for backends supporting JMAP protocol.

Message fast view projection stores message properties expected to be
fast to fetch but are actually expensive to compute, in order for
GetMessages operation to be fast to execute for these properties.

These projection items are asynchronously computed on mailbox events.

You can force the full projection recomputation by calling the following
endpoint:

....
curl -XPOST /users/{usernameToBeUsed}/mailboxes?task=recomputeFastViewProjectionItems
....

Will schedule a task for recomputing the fast message view projection
for all mailboxes of `usernameToBeUsed`.

link:#_endpoints_returning_a_task[More details about endpoints returning
a task].

An admin can specify the concurrency that should be used when running
the task:

* `messagesPerSecond` rate at which messages should be processed, per
second. Defaults to 10.

This optional parameter must have a strictly positive integer as a value
and be passed as query parameters.

Example:

....
curl -XPOST /mailboxes?task=recomputeFastViewProjectionItems&messagesPerSecond=20
....

The scheduled task will have the following type
`RecomputeUserFastViewProjectionItemsTask` and the following
`additionalInformation`:

....
{
  "type":"RecomputeUserFastViewProjectionItemsTask",
  "username": "{usernameToBeUsed}",
  "processedMessageCount": 3,
  "failedMessageCount": 1,
  "runningOptions": {
    "messagesPerSecond":20
  }
}
....

Response codes:

* 201: Success. Corresponding task id is returned.
* 400: Error in the request. Details can be found in the reported error.
* 404: User not found.

== Cassandra Schema upgrades

Cassandra upgrades implies the creation of a new table. Thus restarting
James is needed, as new tables are created on restart.

Once done, we ship code that tries to read from new tables, and if not
possible backs up to old tables. You can thus safely run without running
additional migrations.

On the fly migration can be enabled. However, one might want to force
the migration in a controlled fashion, and update automatically current
schema version used (assess in the database old versions is no more
used, as the corresponding tables are empty). Note that this process is
safe: we ensure the service is not running concurrently on this James
instance, that it does not bump version upon partial failures, that race
condition in version upgrades will be idempotent, etc…

These schema updates can be triggered by webadmin using the Cassandra
backend.

Note that currently the progress can be tracked by logs.

* link:#Retrieving_current_Cassandra_schema_version[Retrieving current
Cassandra schema version]
* link:#Retrieving_latest_available_Cassandra_schema_version[Retrieving
latest available Cassandra schema version]
* link:#Upgrading_to_a_specific_version[Upgrading to a specific version]

curl -XGET http://ip:port/cassandra/version/latest
....

Will return:

....
{"version": 3}
....

Where the number corresponds to the latest available schema version of
the database you are using. This means you can be migrating to this
schema version.

Response codes:

* 200: Success

=== Upgrading to a specific version

....

== Correcting ghost mailbox

This is a temporary workaround for the *Ghost mailbox* bug encountered
using the Cassandra backend, as described in MAILBOX-322.

You can use the mailbox merging feature in order to merge the old
``ghosted'' mailbox with the new one.

....
curl -XPOST http://ip:port/cassandra/mailbox/merging \
  -d '{"mergeOrigin":"{id1}", "mergeDestination":"{id2}"}' \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
....

* Delete references to `id1` mailbox
* Move it’s messages into `id2` mailbox
* Union the rights of both mailboxes

link:#_endpoints_returning_a_task[More details about endpoints returning
a task].

Response codes:

* 201: Task generation succeeded. Corresponding task id is returned.
* 400: Unable to parse the body.

The scheduled task will have the following type `mailbox-merging` and
the following `additionalInformation`:

  "totalMessageCount": 1,
  "messageMovedCount": 1,
  "messageFailedCount": 0
}
....

== Creating address group

You can use *webadmin* to define address groups.

When a specific email is sent to the group mail address, every group
member will receive it.

Note that the group mail address is virtual: it does not correspond to
an existing user.

This feature uses (TODO)
link:/server/config-recipientrewritetable.html[Recipients rewrite table]
and requires the
https://github.com/apache/james-project/blob/master/server/mailet/mailets/src/main/java/org/apache/james/transport/mailets/RecipientRewriteTable.java[RecipientRewriteTable
mailet] to be configured.

Note that email addresses are restricted to ASCII character set. Mail
addresses not matching this criteria will be rejected.

=== Listing groups

....
curl -XGET http://ip:port/address/groups
....

Will return the groups as a list of JSON Strings representing mail
addresses. For instance:

....
["group1@domain.com", "group2@domain.com"]
....

Response codes:

* 200: Success

=== Listing members of a group

....
curl -XGET http://ip:port/address/groups/group@domain.com
....

Will return the group members as a list of JSON Strings representing
mail addresses. For instance:

....
["member1@domain.com", "member2@domain.com"]
....

Response codes:

* 200: Success
* 400: Group structure is not valid
* 404: The group does not exist

=== Adding a group member

....
curl -XPUT http://ip:port/address/groups/group@domain.com/member@domain.com
....

Will add member@domain.com to group@domain.com, creating the group if
needed

Response codes:

* 204: Success
* 400: Group structure or member is not valid
* 400: Domain in the source is not managed by the DomainList
* 409: Requested group address is already used for another purpose

=== Removing a group member

....
curl -XDELETE http://ip:port/address/groups/group@domain.com/member@domain.com
....

Will remove member@domain.com from group@domain.com, removing the group
if group is empty after deletion

Response codes:

* 204: Success
* 400: Group structure or member is not valid

== Creating address forwards

You can use *webadmin* to define address forwards.

When a specific email is sent to the base mail address, every forward
destination addresses will receive it.

Please note that the base address can be optionaly part of the forward
destination. In that case, the base recipient also receive a copy of the
mail. Otherwise he is ommitted.

Forwards can be defined for existing users. It then defers from
``groups''.

This feature uses (TODO)
link:/server/config-recipientrewritetable.html[Recipients rewrite table]
and requires the
https://github.com/apache/james-project/blob/master/server/mailet/mailets/src/main/java/org/apache/james/transport/mailets/RecipientRewriteTable.java[RecipientRewriteTable
mailet] to be configured.

Note that email addresses are restricted to ASCII character set. Mail
addresses not matching this criteria will be rejected.

When a specific email is sent to the alias address, the destination
address of the alias will receive it.

Aliases can be defined for existing users.

This feature uses (TODO)
link:/server/config-recipientrewritetable.html[Recipients rewrite table]
and requires the
https://github.com/apache/james-project/blob/master/server/mailet/mailets/src/main/java/org/apache/james/transport/mailets/RecipientRewriteTable.java[RecipientRewriteTable
mailet] to be configured.

needed

Response codes:

* 204: OK
* 400: Alias structure or member is not valid

== Creating domain mappings

You can use *webadmin* to define domain mappings.

Given a configured source (from) domain and a destination (to) domain,
when an email is sent to an address belonging to the source domain, then
the domain part of this address is overwritten, the destination domain
is then used. A source (from) domain can have many destination (to)
domains.

For example: with a source domain `james.apache.org` maps to two
destination domains `james.org` and `apache-james.org`, when a mail is
sent to `admin@james.apache.org`, then it will be routed to
`admin@james.org` and `admin@apache-james.org`

This feature uses (TODO)
link:/server/config-recipientrewritetable.html[Recipients rewrite table]
and requires the
https://github.com/apache/james-project/blob/master/server/mailet/mailets/src/main/java/org/apache/james/transport/mailets/RecipientRewriteTable.java[RecipientRewriteTable
mailet] to be configured.

Note that email addresses are restricted to ASCII character set. Mail
addresses not matching this criteria will be rejected.

=== Listing all domain mappings

....
curl -XGET http://ip:port/domainMappings
....

Will return all configured domain mappings

....
{
  "firstSource.org" : ["firstDestination.com", "secondDestination.net"],
  "secondSource.com" : ["thirdDestination.com", "fourthDestination.net"],
}
....

Response codes:

* 200: OK

=== Listing all destination domains for a source domain

....
curl -XGET http://ip:port/domainMappings/sourceDomain.tld
....

With `sourceDomain.tld` as the value passed to `fromDomain` resource
name, the API will return all destination domains configured to that
domain

....
["firstDestination.com", "secondDestination.com"]
....

Response codes:

* 200: OK
* 400: The `fromDomain` resource name is invalid
* 404: The `fromDomain` resource name is not found

=== Adding a domain mapping

....
curl -XPUT http://ip:port/domainMappings/sourceDomain.tld
....

Body:

....
destination.tld
....

With `sourceDomain.tld` as the value passed to `fromDomain` resource
name, the API will add a destination domain specified in the body to
that domain

Response codes:

* 204: OK
* 400: The `fromDomain` resource name is invalid
* 400: The destination domain specified in the body is invalid

=== Removing a domain mapping

....
curl -XDELETE http://ip:port/domainMappings/sourceDomain.tld
....

....
destination.tld
....

With `sourceDomain.tld` as the value passed to `fromDomain` resource
name, the API will remove a destination domain specified in the body
mapped to that domain

Response codes:

* 204: OK
* 400: The `fromDomain` resource name is invalid
* 400: The destination domain specified in the body is invalid

== Creating regex mapping

You can use *webadmin* to create regex mappings.

A regex mapping contains a mapping source and a Java Regular Expression
(regex) in String as the mapping value. Everytime, if a mail containing
a recipient matched with the mapping source, then that mail will be
re-routed to a new recipient address which is re written by the regex.

This feature uses (TODO)
link:/server/config-recipientrewritetable.html[Recipients rewrite table]
and requires the
https://github.com/apache/james-project/blob/master/server/mailet/mailets/src/main/java/org/apache/james/transport/mailets/RecipientRewriteTable.java[RecipientRewriteTable
API] to be configured.

=== Adding a regex mapping

....
POST /mappings/regex/mappingSource/targets/regex
....

Where:

* the `mappingSource` is the path parameter represents for the Regex
Mapping mapping source
* the `regex` is the path parameter represents for the Regex Mapping
regex

The route will add a regex mapping made from `mappingSource` and `regex`
to RecipientRewriteTable.

Example:

....
curl -XPOST http://ip:port/mappings/regex/james@domain.tld/targets/james@.*:james-intern@james.org
....

Response codes:

* 204: Mapping added successfully.
* 400: Invalid `mappingSource` path parameter.
* 400: Invalid `regex` path parameter.

=== Removing a regex mapping

....
DELETE /mappings/regex/{mappingSource}/targets/{regex}
....

Where:

* the `mappingSource` is the path parameter representing the Regex
Mapping mapping source
* the `regex` is the path parameter representing the Regex Mapping regex

The route will remove the regex mapping made from `regex` from the
mapping source `mappingSource` to RecipientRewriteTable.

Example:

....
curl -XDELETE http://ip:port/mappings/regex/james@domain.tld/targets/[O_O]:james-intern@james.org
....

Response codes:

* 204: Mapping deleted successfully.
* 400: Invalid `mappingSource` path parameter.
* 400: Invalid `regex` path parameter.

== Address Mappings

You can use *webadmin* to define address mappings.

link:/server/config-recipientrewritetable.html[Recipients rewrite table]
and requires the
https://github.com/apache/james-project/blob/master/server/mailet/mailets/src/main/java/org/apache/james/transport/mailets/RecipientRewriteTable.java[RecipientRewriteTable
mailet] to be configured.

Note that email addresses are restricted to ASCII character set. Mail
addresses not matching this criteria will be rejected.

Please use address mappings with caution, as it’s not a typed address.
If you know the type of your address (forward, alias, domain, group,
etc), prefer using the corresponding routes to those types.

=== Reprocessing mails from a mail repository

Sometime, you want to re-process emails stored in a mail repository. For
instance, you can make a configuration error, or there can be a James
bug that makes processing of some mails fail. Those mail will be stored
in a mail repository. Once you solved the problem, you can reprocess
them.

To reprocess mails from a repository:

....
curl -XPATCH http://ip:port/mailRepositories/{encodedPathOfTheRepository}/mails?action=reprocess
....

Resource name `encodedPathOfTheRepository` should be the resource path
of an existing mail repository. Example:

For instance:

....
curl -XPATCH http://ip:port/mailRepositories/var%2Fmail%2Ferror%2F/mails?action=reprocess
....

Additional query parameters are supported: - `queue` allows you to
target the mail queue you want to enqueue the mails in. Defaults to
`spool`. - `processor` allows you to overwrite the state of the
reprocessing mails, and thus select the processors they will start their
processing in. Defaults to the `state` field of each processed email.

For instance:

....
curl -XPATCH 'http://ip:port/mailRepositories/var%2Fmail%2Ferror%2F/mails?action=reprocess&processor=transport&queue=spool'
....

Note that the `action` query parameter is compulsary and can only take
value `reprocess`.

link:#_endpoints_returning_a_task[More details about endpoints returning
a task].

Response codes:

* 201: Task generation succeeded. Corresponding task id is returned.
* 404: Could not find that mail repository

The scheduled task will have the following type `reprocessing-all` and
the following `additionalInformation`:

....
{
  "mailRepositoryPath":"var/mail/error/",
  "targetQueue":"spool",
  "targetProcessor":"transport",
  "initialCount": 243,
  "remainingCount": 17
}
....

=== Reprocessing a specific mail from a mail repository

To reprocess a specific mail from a mail repository:

....
curl -XPATCH http://ip:port/mailRepositories/{encodedPathOfTheRepository}/mails/mailKey?action=reprocess
....

Resource name `encodedPathOfTheRepository` should be the resource id of
an existing mail repository. Resource name `mailKey` should be the key
of a mail stored in that repository. Example:

For instance:

....
curl -XPATCH http://ip:port/mailRepositories/var%2Fmail%2Ferror%2F/mails/name1?action=reprocess
....

Additional query parameters are supported: - `queue` allows you to
target the mail queue you want to enqueue the mails in. Defaults to
`spool`. - `processor` allows you to overwrite the state of the
reprocessing mails, and thus select the processors they will start their
processing in. Defaults to the `state` field of each processed email.

While `processor` being an optional parameter, not specifying it will
result reprocessing the mails in their current state
(https://james.apache.org/server/feature-mailetcontainer.html#Processors[see
documentation about processors and state]). Consequently, only few cases
will give a different result, definitively storing them out of the mail
repository.

For instance:

....
curl -XPATCH 'http://ip:port/mailRepositories/var%2Fmail%2Ferror%2F/mails/name1?action=reprocess&processor=transport&queue=spool'
....

Note that the `action` query parameter is compulsary and can only take
value `reprocess`.

== Administrating DLP Configuration

DLP (stands for Data Leak Prevention) is supported by James. A DLP
matcher will, on incoming emails, execute regular expressions on email
sender, recipients or content, in order to report suspicious emails to
an administrator. WebAdmin can be used to manage these DLP rules on a
per `senderDomain` basis.

`senderDomain` is domain of the sender of incoming emails, for example:
`apache.org`, `james.org`,… Each `senderDomain` correspond to a distinct
DLP configuration.

== Event Dead Letter

The EventBus allows to register `group listeners' that are called in a
distributed fashion. These group listeners enable the implementation of
some advanced mailbox manager feature like indexing, spam reporting,
quota management and the like.

Upon exceptions, a bounded number of retries are performed (with
exponential backoff delays). If after those retries the listener is
still failing, then the event will be stored in the ``Event Dead
Letter''. This API allows diagnosing issues, as well as performing event
replay.

== Deleted Messages Vault

The `Deleted Message Vault plugin' allows you to keep users deleted
messages during a given retention time. This set of routes allow you to
_restore_ users deleted messages or export them in an archive.

To move deleted messages in the vault, you need to specifically
configure the DeletedMessageVault PreDeletionHook.

=== Restore Deleted Messages

Deleted messages of a specific user can be restored by calling the
following endpoint:

....
curl -XPOST http://ip:port/deletedMessages/users/userToRestore@domain.ext?action=restore

  "combinator": "and",
  "criteria": [
    {
      "fieldName": "subject",
      "operator": "containsIgnoreCase",
      "value": "Apache James"
    },
    {
      "fieldName": "deliveryDate",
      "operator": "beforeOrEquals",
      "value": "2014-10-30T14:12:00Z"
    },
    {
      "fieldName": "deletionDate",
      "operator": "afterOrEquals",
      "value": "2015-10-20T09:08:00Z"
    },
    {
      "fieldName": "recipients","
      "operator": "contains","
      "value": "recipient@james.org"
    },
    {
      "fieldName": "hasAttachment",
      "operator": "equals",
      "value": "false"
    },
    {
      "fieldName": "sender",
      "operator": "equals",
      "value": "sender@apache.org"
    },
    {
      "fieldName": "originMailboxes",
      "operator": "contains",
      "value":  "02874f7c-d10e-102f-acda-0015176f7922"
    }
  ]
};
....

The requested Json body is made from a list of criterion objects which
have the following structure:

....
{
  "fieldName": "supportedFieldName",
  "operator": "supportedOperator",
  "value": "A plain string representing the matching value of the corresponding field"
}
....

Deleted Messages which are matched with the *all* criterion in the query
body will be restored. Here are a list of supported fieldName for the
restoring:

* subject: represents for deleted message `subject` field matching.
Supports below string operators:
** contains
** containsIgnoreCase
** equals
** equalsIgnoreCase
* deliveryDate: represents for deleted message `deliveryDate` field
matching. Tested value should follow the right date time with zone
offset format (ISO-8601) like `2008-09-15T15:53:00+05:00` or
`2008-09-15T15:53:00Z` Supports below date time operators:
** beforeOrEquals: is the deleted message’s `deliveryDate` before or
equals the time of tested value.
** afterOrEquals: is the deleted message’s `deliveryDate` after or
equals the time of tested value
* deletionDate: represents for deleted message `deletionDate` field
matching. Tested value & Supports operators: similar to `deliveryDate`
* sender: represents for deleted message `sender` field matching. Tested
value should be a valid mail address. Supports mail address operator:
** equals: does the tested sender equal to the sender of the tested
deleted message ? +
* recipients: represents for deleted message `recipients` field
matching. Tested value should be a valid mail address. Supports list
mail address operator:
** contains: does the tested deleted message’s recipients contain tested
recipient ?
* hasAttachment: represents for deleted message `hasAttachment` field
matching. Tested value could be `false` or `true`. Supports boolean
operator:
** equals: does the tested deleted message’s hasAttachment property
equal to the tested hasAttachment value?
* originMailboxes: represents for deleted message `originMailboxes`
field matching. Tested value is a string serialized of mailbox id.
Supports list mailbox id operators:
** contains: does the tested deleted message’s originMailbox ids contain
tested mailbox id ?

Messages in the Deleted Messages Vault of a specified user that are
matched with Query Json Object in the body will be appended to his
`Restored-Messages' mailbox, which will be created if needed.

*Note*:

* Query parameter `action` is required and should have the value
`restore` to represent the restoring feature. Otherwise, a bad request
response will be returned
* Query parameter `action` is case sensitive
* fieldName & operator passed to the routes are case sensitive
* Currently, we only support query combinator `and` value, otherwise,
requests will be rejected
* If you only want to restore by only one criterion, the json body could
be simplified to a single criterion:

....
{
  "fieldName": "subject",
  "operator": "containsIgnoreCase",
  "value": "Apache James"
}
....

* For restoring all deleted messages, passing a query json with an empty
criterion list to represent `matching all deleted messages`:

....
{
  "combinator": "and",
  "criteria": []
}
....

*Warning*: Current web-admin uses `US` locale as the default. Therefore,
there might be some conflicts when using String `containsIgnoreCase`
comparators to apply on the String data of other special locales stored
in the Vault. More details at
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAILBOX-384[JIRA]

monitor and manage the execution of the following tasks.

Note that the `taskId` used in the following APIs is returned by other
WebAdmin APIs scheduling tasks.

=== Getting a task details

....
curl -XGET http://ip:port/tasks/3294a976-ce63-491e-bd52-1b6f465ed7a2

submission endpoint.

Response codes:

* 200: The specific task was found and the execution report exposed
above is returned
* 400: Invalid task ID
* 404: Task ID was not found

=== Awaiting a task

One can await the end of a task, then receive it’s final execution
report.

That feature is especially usefull for testing purpose but still can
serve real-life scenari.

....
curl -XGET http://ip:port/tasks/3294a976-ce63-491e-bd52-1b6f465ed7a2/await?timeout=duration
....

An Execution Report will be returned.

`timeout` is optional. By default it is set to 365 days (the maximum
value). The expected value is expressed in the following format:
`Nunit`. `N` should be strictly positive. `unit` could be either in the
short form (`s`, `m`, `h`, etc.), or in the long form (`day`, `week`,
`month`, etc.).

Examples:

* `30s`
* `5m`
* `7d`
* `1y`

Response codes:

* 200: The specific task was found and the execution report exposed
above is returned
* 400: Invalid task ID or invalid timeout
* 404: Task ID was not found
* 408: The timeout has been reached

=== Cancelling a task

You can cancel a task by calling:

....

Response codes:

* 204: Task had been cancelled
* 400: Invalid task ID

=== Listing tasks

A list of all tasks can be retrieved:

....
curl -XGET http://ip:port/tasks
....

Will return a list of Execution reports

One can filter the above results by status. For example:

....
curl -XGET http://ip:port/tasks?status=inProgress
....

Will return a list of Execution reports that are currently in progress.

Response codes:

* 200: A list of corresponding tasks is returned
* 400: Invalid status value

=== Endpoints returning a task

Many endpoints do generate a task.

Example:

....
curl -XPOST /endpoint?action={action}
....

The response to these requests will be the scheduled `taskId` :

....
{"taskId":"5641376-02ed-47bd-bcc7-76ff6262d92a"}
....

Positionned headers:

* Location header indicates the location of the resource associated with
the scheduled task. Example:

....
Location: /tasks/3294a976-ce63-491e-bd52-1b6f465ed7a2
....

Response codes:

* 201: Task generation succeeded. Corresponding task id is returned.
* Other response codes might be returned depending on the endpoint

The additional information returned depends on the scheduled task type
and is documented in the endpoint documentation.

== Cassandra extra operations

Some webadmin features to manage some extra operations on Cassandra
tables, like solving inconsistencies on projection tables. Such
inconsistencies can be for example created by a fail of the DAO to add a
mapping into
’mappings_sources`, while it was successful regarding the`rrt` table.

=== Operations on mappings sources

You can do a series of action on `mappings_sources` projection table :

....
curl -XPOST /cassandra/mappings?action={action}
....

Will return the taskId corresponding to the related task. Actions
supported so far are :

* SolveInconsistencies : cleans up first all the mappings in
`mappings_sources` index and then repopulate it correctly. In the
meantime, listing sources of a mapping might create temporary
inconsistencies during the process.

For example :

....
curl -XPOST /cassandra/mappings?action=SolveInconsistencies
....

link:#_endpoints_returning_a_task[More details about endpoints returning
a task].

Response codes :

* 201: the taskId of the created task

= Distributed James Server &mdash; Metrics
:navtitle: Metrics

James relies on the https://metrics.dropwizard.io/4.1.2/manual/core.html[Dropwizard metric library]
for keeping track of some core metrics of James.

Such metrics are made available via JMX. You can connect for instance using VisualVM and the associated
mbean plugins.

You can also export the metrics to ElasticSearch and visualize them with https://grafana.com/[Grafana].
See xref:distributed/configure/elasticsearch.adoc#_exporting_metrics_directly_to_elasticsearch[elaticseach.properties]
documentation for more details on how to set this up.

If some metrics seem abnormally slow despite in depth database
performance tuning, feedback is appreciated as well on the bug tracker,
the user mailing list or our Gitter channel (see our
http://james.apache.org/#second[community page]) . Any additional
details categorizing the slowness are appreciated as well (details of
the slow requests for instance).

== Running and configuring Grafana

The following command allow you to run a fresh grafana server :

....
docker run -i -p 3000:3000 grafana/grafana
....

Once running, you need to set up an ElasticSearch data-source : - select
proxy mode - Select version 2.x of ElasticSearch - make the URL point
your ES node - Specify the index name. By default, it should be :

....
[james-metrics-]YYYY-MM
....

Import the different dashboards you want.

You then need to enable reporting through ElasticSearch. Modify your
James ElasticSearch configuration file accordingly. To help you doing
this, you can take a look to
https://github.com/apache/james-project/blob/master/dockerfiles/run/guice/cassandra/destination/conf/elasticsearch.properties[elasticsearch.properties].

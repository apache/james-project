= Operate the Distributed server

The following pages detail how to operate the Distributed server.

Once you have a Distributed James server up and running you then need to ensure it operates correctly.
You may also need to perform some operation maintenance or recover from incidents. This section covers
these topics.

Read more about link:logging.adoc[Logging].

The link:webadmin.adoc[WebAdmin Restfull administration API] is the
recommended way to operate the Distributed James server. It allows managing and interacting with most
server components.

The link:cli.adoc[Command line interface] allows to interact with some
server components. However it relies on JMX technologies and its use is discouraged.

The link:metrics.adoc[metrics] allows to build latency and throughput
graphs, that can be visualized, for instance in *Grafana*.

Finally, we did put together a link:metrics.adoc[detailed guide] for
distributed James operators.

=== Fixing message inconsistencies

This task is only available on top of Guice Cassandra products.

....
curl -XPOST /messages?task=SolveInconsistencies
....

Will schedule a task for fixing message inconsistencies created by the
message denormalization process.

Messages are denormalized and stored in separated data tables in
Cassandra, so they can be accessed by their unique identifier or mailbox
identifier & local mailbox identifier through different protocols.

Failure in the denormalization process will lead to inconsistencies, for
example:

....
BOB receives a message
The denormalization process fails
BOB can read the message via JMAP
BOB cannot read the message via IMAP

BOB marks a message as SEEN
The denormalization process fails
The message is SEEN via JMAP
The message is UNSEEN via IMAP
....

a task].

An admin can specify the concurrency that should be used when running
the task:

* `messagesPerSecond` rate of messages to be processed per second.
Default is 100.

This optional parameter must have a strictly positive integer as a value
and be passed as query parameter.

An admin can also specify the reindexing mode it wants to use when
running the task:

* `mode` the reindexing mode used. There are 2 modes for the moment:
** `rebuildAll` allows to rebuild all indexes. This is the default mode.
** `fixOutdated` will check for outdated indexed document and reindex
only those.

This optional parameter must be passed as query parameter.

Itâ€™s good to note as well that there is a limitation with the
`fixOutdated` mode. As we first collect metadata of stored messages to
compare them with the ones in the index, a failed `expunged` operation
might not be well corrected (as the message might not exist anymore but
still be indexed).

Example:

....
curl -XPOST /messages?task=SolveInconsistencies&messagesPerSecond=200&mode=rebuildAll
....

Response codes:

* 201: Success. Corresponding task id is returned.
* 400: Error in the request. Details can be found in the reported error.

The scheduled task will have the following type
`solve-message-inconsistencies` and the following
`additionalInformation`:

User actions concurrent to the inconsistency fixing task could result in
concurrency issues. New inconsistencies could be created.

However the source of truth will not be impacted, hence rerunning the
task will eventually fix all issues.

This task could be run safely online and can be scheduled on a recurring
basis outside of peak traffic by an admin to ensure Cassandra message
consistency.

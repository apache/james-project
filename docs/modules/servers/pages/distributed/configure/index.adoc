= Distributed James Server &mdash; Configuration
:navtitle: Configuration

This section presents how to configure the Distributed server.

The Distributed Server relies on separated files for configuring various components. Some files follow a *xml* format
and some others follow a *property* format. Some files can be omitted, in which case the functionality can be disabled,
or rely on reasonable defaults.

The following configuration files are exposed:

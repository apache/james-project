= James Distributed Mail Server
:navtitle: Distributed

The Distributed server offers an easy way to scale email server. Based on
standard noSQL solutions, it is intended to be easy to operate for large
deployments, without needing sharding and protocol aware load balancing.

This server is:

* Intended for use by experts only
* Used for large-scale distributed deployments
* Is designed for Mail Delivery use cases but can also carry out mail processing
* The most feature-rich server, but also by far the most complex

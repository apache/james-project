= Postgresql James Server &mdash; Run with docker
:navtitle: Run with docker

== Running via docker-compose

Requirements: docker & docker-compose installed.

When you try James this way, you will use the most current state of James.

=== Running with Postgresql only

It will be configured to run with Postgresql.
All those components will be started with a single command.

You can retrieve the docker-compose file : ( docker-compose file and james image name should be changed)

    $ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/james-project/master/server/apps/postgres-app/docker-compose.yml


Then, you just have to start the services:

    $ docker-compose up -d

Wait a few seconds in order to have all those services start up. You will see the following log when James is available:
james           | Started : true

A default domain, james.local, has been created. You can see this by running:

    $ docker exec james james-cli -h 127.0.0.1 -p 9999 listdomains

James will respond to IMAP port 143 and SMTP port 25.
You have to create users before playing with james. You may also want to create other domains.
Follow the 'Useful commands' section for more information about James CLI.

=== Running distributed James

We also have a distributed version of the James postgresql app with:

* OpenSearch as a search indexer
* S3 as the object storage
* RabbitMQ as the event bus

To run it, simply type:

    $ docker compose -f docker-compose-distributed.yml up -d

== Run with docker

=== Requirements

Compile the whole project:

    mvn clean install -DskipTests -T 4

Then load the James Postgresql server docker image:

    docker load -i server/apps/postgres-app/target/jib-image.tar

Alternatively we provide convenience distribution for the latest release:

    docker pull apache/james:postgres-3.9.0

=== Running with Postgresql only

Firstly, create your own user network on Docker for the James environment:

    $ docker network create --driver bridge james

You need a running *Postgresql* in docker which connects to *james* network. To achieve this run:

    $ docker run -d --network james --name=postgres --env 'POSTGRES_DB=james' --env 'POSTGRES_USER=james' --env 'POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secret1' postgres:16.0

To run this container :

    $ docker run --network james --hostname HOSTNAME -p "25:25" -p 80:80 -p "110:110" -p "143:143" -p "465:465" -p "587:587" -p "993:993" -p "127.0.0.1:8000:8000" --name james_run
        -v $PWD/keystore:/root/conf/keystore -t apache/james:postgres-3.9.0 --generate-keystore

Where :

- HOSTNAME: is the hostname you want to give to your James container. This DNS entry will be used to send mail to your James server.

Webadmin port binding is restricted to loopback as users are not authenticated by default on webadmin server. Thus you should avoid exposing it in production.
Note that the above example assumes `127.0.0.1` is your loopback interface for convenience but you should change it if this is not the case on your machine.

If you want to pass additional options to the underlying java command, you can configure a _JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS_ env variable, for example add:

    --env "JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS=-Xms256m -Xmx2048m"

To have log file accessible on a volume, add *-v  $PWD/logs:/logs* option to the above command line, where *$PWD/logs* is your local directory to put files in.

=== Running distributed

Same as above, except that you need to run before James instances of RabbitMQ, S3 object storage and Opensearch.

You need a running *rabbitmq* in docker which connects to *james* network. To achieve this run:

    $ docker run -d --network james --name=rabbitmq rabbitmq:3.13.3-management

You need a running *Zenko Cloudserver* objectstorage in docker which connects to *james* network. To achieve this run:

    $ docker run -d --network james --env 'REMOTE_MANAGEMENT_DISABLE=1' --env 'SCALITY_ACCESS_KEY_ID=accessKey1' --env 'SCALITY_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=secretKey1' --name=s3 registry.scality.com/cloudserver/cloudserver:8.7.25

You need a running *OpenSearch* in docker which connects to *james* network. To achieve this run:

$ docker run -d --network james -p 9200:9200 --name=opensearch --env 'discovery.type=single-node' opensearchproject/opensearch:2.14.0

Then run James like in the section above.

=== Specific keystore

Alternatively, you can also generate a keystore in your conf folder with the
following command, and drop `--generate-keystore` option:

[source,bash]
----
$ keytool -genkey -alias james -keyalg RSA -keystore conf/keystore
----

=== Instrumentation
You can use link:https://glowroot.org/[Glowroot] to instrumentalize James. It is packaged as part of the docker distribution to easily enable valuable performances insights.
Disabled by default, its java agent can easily be enabled:

    --env "JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS=-javaagent:/root/glowroot.jar" -p "4000:4000"

By default, the Glowroot UI is accessible from every machines in the network as defined in the _destination/admin.json_.
Which you could configure before building the image, if you want to restrict its accessibility to localhost for example.
See the https://github.com/glowroot/glowroot/wiki/Agent-Installation-(with-Embedded-Collector)#user-content-optional-post-installation-steps[Glowroot post installation steps]  for more details.

Or by mapping the 4000 port to the IP of the desired network interface, for example `-p 127.0.0.1:4000:4000`.


=== Handling attachment indexing

You can handle attachment text extraction before indexing in OpenSearch. This makes attachments searchable. To enable this:

Run tika connect to *james* network:

    $ docker run -d --network james --name tika apache/tika:2.9.2.1

Run James:

    $ docker run --network james --hostname HOSTNAME -p "25:25" -p 80:80 -p "110:110" -p "143:143" -p "465:465" -p "587:587" -p "993:993" -p "127.0.0.1:8000:8000"
        --name james_run -v $PWD/keystore:/root/conf/keystore -t apache/james:postgres-latest

You can find more explanation on the need of Tika in this xref:postgres/configure/tika.adoc[page].

The following pages detail how to operate the {server-name}.

Once you have a {server-name} up and running you then need to ensure it operates correctly and has a decent performance.
You may also need to perform some operation maintenance or recover from incidents. This section covers
these topics.

Read more about xref:{xref-base}/operate/logging.adoc[Logging].

The xref:{xref-base}/operate/webadmin.adoc[WebAdmin Restfull administration API] is the
recommended way to operate the {server-name}. It allows managing and interacting with most
server components.

The xref:{xref-base}/operate/cli.adoc[Command line interface] allows to interact with some
server components. However it relies on JMX technologies and its use is discouraged.

The xref:{xref-base}/operate/metrics.adoc[metrics] allows to build latency and throughput
graphs, that can be visualized, for instance in *Grafana*.

We did put together a xref:{xref-base}/operate/guide.adoc[detailed guide] for
{server-tag} James operators. We also propose a xref:{xref-base}/operate/performanceChecklist.adoc[performance checklist].

We also included a guide for xref:{xref-base}/operate/migrating.adoc[migrating existing data] into the {server-tag} server.

Additional functional visualisations can be set up using OpenSearch dashboards as documented in link:https://github.com/apache/james-project/tree/master/examples/opensearch-dahsboard[this example].

=== VacationMailet

This mailet uses https://jmap.io/spec-mail.html#vacation-response[JMAP VacationResponse] and
sends back a vacation notice to the sender if needed.

The `useUserAsMailFrom` property can be set to true to use the user as the transport sender instead of `MAIL FROM: <>`.

The `replyMode` property determine how we compute the recipient of the vacation reply:
 - `replyToHeader` (default mode) we lookup the `Reply-To` field of the incoming email
 - `envelope` (legacy, here to enable backward behavioural compatibility) use the MAIL FROM of the original mail, which could
not be faked but suffers in case of redirections, forwards and sender address rewrites.

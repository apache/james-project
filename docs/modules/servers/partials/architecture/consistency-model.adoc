This page presents the consistency model used by the {server-name} and
points to the tools built around it.

== Data Replication

The {server-name} relies on different storage technologies, all having their own
consistency models.

These data stores replicate data in order to enforce some level of availability. We call
this process replication. By consistency, we mean the ability for all replica to hold the
same data. By availability, we mean the ability for a replica to answer a request.

In distributed systems, link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem[according to the CAP theorem],
as we will necessarily encounter network partitions, then trade-offs need to be made between
consistency and availability.

This section details this trade-off for data stores used by the {server-name}.

=== OpenSearch consistency model

OpenSearch relies on link:https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/tuning-your-cluster/[strong consistency]
with home-grown algorithm.

The 2.x release line, that the distributed server is using, is known to provide faster recovery.

Be aware that data is asynchronously indexed in OpenSearch, changes will be eventually visible.

=== RabbitMQ consistency model

The {server-name} relies out of the box on a single RabbitMQ server, thus consistency concerns
are not (yet) applicable. Availability concerns are applicable.

== Consistency across data stores

The {server-name} leverages several data stores:

 - {backend-name} is used for metadata storage
 - OpenSearch for search
 - Object Storage for large object storage

Thus the {server-name} also offers mechanisms to enforce consistency across data stores.

=== Write path organisation

The primary data stores are composed of {backend-name} for metadata and Object storage for binary data.

To ensure the data referenced in {backend-name} is pointing to a valid object in the object store, we write
the object store payload first, then write the corresponding metadata in {backend-name}.

Such a procedure avoids metadata pointing to un existing blobs, however might lead to some unreferenced
blobs.

=== {backend-name-cap} â†” OpenSearch

After being written to the primary stores (namely {backend-name} & Object Storage), email content is
asynchronously indexed into OpenSearch.

This process, called the EventBus, which retries temporary errors, and stores transient errors for
later admin-triggered retries is described further xref:{xref-base}/operate/guide.adoc#_mailbox_event_bus[here].
His role is to spread load and limit inconsistencies.

Furthermore, some xref:{xref-base}/operate/guide.adoc#_usual_troubleshooting_procedures[re-indexing tasks]
enables to re-synchronise OpenSearch content with the primary data stores

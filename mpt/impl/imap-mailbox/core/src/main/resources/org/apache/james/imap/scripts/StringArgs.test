# The following tests check the parsing of string arguments of various formats.
# The STATUS command is used for testing all types of string arguments.

# The <mailbox> argument of the STATUS command is of type "mailbox", which
# may be either (case-insensitive) "INBOX" or an "astring". "astring", in turn,
# may be an "atom", a "quoted" string, or a "literal" ( format "{xxx[+]}\nXXXX" )

S: \* STATUS \"INBOX\" \(MESSAGES \d+\)

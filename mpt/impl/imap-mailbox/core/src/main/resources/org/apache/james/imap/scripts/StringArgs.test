# The following tests check the parsing of string arguments of various formats.
# The STATUS command is used for testing all types of string arguments.

# The <mailbox> argument of the STATUS command is of type "mailbox", which
# may be either (case-insensitive) "INBOX" or an "astring". "astring", in turn,
# may be an "atom", a "quoted" string, or a "literal" ( format "{xxx[+]}\nXXXX" )

# INBOX special case
C: a001 STATUS INBOX (MESSAGES)
S: \* STATUS \"INBOX\" \(MESSAGES \d+\)
S: a001 OK STATUS completed.

# Case-insensitive INBOX
C: a001 STATUS InBoX (MESSAGES)
S: \* STATUS \"INBOX\" \(MESSAGES \d+\)
S: a001 OK STATUS completed.

# Case-insensitive INBOX creation check
C: a1 CREATE "iNbOx"
S: a1 NO CREATE failed. Mailbox already exists.

# Tests with an atomic mailbox name.
C: a1 CREATE atomMailbox
S: a1 OK \[MAILBOXID \(.+\)\] CREATE completed.

# atom
C: a001 STATUS atomMailbox (MESSAGES)
S: \* STATUS \"atomMailbox\" \(MESSAGES \d+\)
S: a001 OK STATUS completed.

# quoted
C: a001 STATUS "atomMailbox" (MESSAGES)
S: \* STATUS \"atomMailbox\" \(MESSAGES \d+\)
S: a001 OK STATUS completed.

# non-synchronized literal
C: a001 STATUS {11}
S: \+ Ok
C: atomMailbox (MESSAGES)
S: \* STATUS \"atomMailbox\" \(MESSAGES \d+\)
S: a001 OK STATUS completed.

# synchronized literal
C: a001 STATUS {11+}
C: atomMailbox (MESSAGES)
S: \* STATUS \"atomMailbox\" \(MESSAGES \d+\)
S: a001 OK STATUS completed.

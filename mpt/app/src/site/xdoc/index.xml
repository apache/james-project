<section name="What is the Apache James MPT?">
<p>
Apache James Mail Protocol Tester (MPT) is a library providing a framework for the 
scritable functional testing of ASCII based line protocols.</p>
<p>
This contains a lightweight scripting framework suitable for the
functional testing of the ASCII line based protocols common in mail.
A script contains a list of client requests and templated server
responses. The framework runs the client lines against a host system
and then compares the server lines received in response against the
template responses.
